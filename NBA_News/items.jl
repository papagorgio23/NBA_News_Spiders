{"team": "hawks", "url": "https://www.nba.com/hawks/community/lloyd-pierce-hosts-first-annual-spades-tournament", "date": "2020-03-04 00:00:00", "tags": ["Pierce, Lloyd", "Hawks"], "article": " By: KL\u00a0Chouinard @KLChouinard If you're trying to gauge how serious Lloyd Pierce is about the card game\u00a0Spades, don't base it on the fact that he has played it for as long as he can remember. And don't base it on the fact that Pierce has wanted to hold a\u00a0Spades\u00a0tournament in Atlanta from the moment he became the Hawks head coach.  Instead, base it on his relationship\u00a0with his partner.  \"No lie. My wife and I have it in our vows. We spoke about being\u00a0spades\u00a0partners in our vows at our wedding. It's serious.\"  So when Pierce did hold his first Community\u00a0Spades\u00a0Tournament in Southwest Atlanta, he made a point of finding like-minded players to fill out the 68 teams. The people that he did\u00a0not\u00a0want were the ones who said that they knew how to play\u00a0spades. Instead, he wanted the ones who were offended that he would even dare to ask such a question.  \"If they looked at me funny, those are the types of people that we want.\"  The participants at the William Walker Recreation Center consisted mostly of local\u00a0spades\u00a0players, plus some season ticket holders and special guests. The event was billed as a way to engage families and\u00a0the local community, and that sentiment was evident with everyone in attendance, including a few Hawks players.  Pajama-clad,\u00a0eight-month-old\u00a0Tobias Graham\u00a0toddled around card tables between rounds while smiling and having his outstretched arms guided from above by his dad (and Hawks forward), Treveon. Guard\u00a0Brandon Goodwin beamed over his selection of a partner.  \"My Auntie. She came down here from South Carolina for the weekend, so I decided to bring her out here and let her whip up on some people real quick,\" he said with a laugh.  Pierce touched on the sentiment of the game more directly.  \"It symbolizes the importance of bringing community and bringing family and keeping family together. At the very end of the day, no matter what the date or current situation, you can sit around \u2013 whether it's around drinks or food \u2013 you can sit there for hours and enjoy your family and that's what this is about.\"  Like Goodwin, Pierce grew up playing the game with aunts and other family members.  \"That's kind of the growing up process. I have aunts that are serious about\u00a0spades. When you're a kid playing, like, if you sit with my aunt and renege on a bid, she might not talk to you for a couple of days. We were on a cruise, and I don't know who she was playing with, but her partner reneged. She didn't talk to that person for the rest of the cruise.\"  Hawks forward John Collins attended without a partner. He had planned on playing with his uncle, who ended up not being able to make it. The\u00a0Spades\u00a0tournament had an UNO tournament running simultaneously in an adjacent room for any kids who attended, so Collins headed next door to play UNO. The only problem? When Collins walked into a room full of 12- and 15-year-old kids, those kids no longer wanted to play UNO. They want to get up close, talk to Collins, tell him jokes and share a laugh. Then they wanted an autograph. The UNO had to wait until after he left.  On the\u00a0Spades\u00a0half of the building, there was a fair bit of chatter about the\u00a0rules. Card players who grew up in the South, like Norcross' Brandon Goodwin, were quite comfortable with the joker-joker-deuce-deuce format. Pierce and Graham, on the other hand, grew up in other parts of the country and adjusted to the format on the fly.  \"I've never played with the twos being high cards,\" Pierce said with a grimace. \"I learned about it this morning. When my wife and I were driving here, we were going over strategy in the car. There are 16\u00a0spades\u00a0now and that's how you have to look at it. I'm trying to be a man of the people and that's the Southern Rules.\"  State Farm sponsored the event, and it is one that Pierce hopes to turn into an annual gathering.  \"The plan is to grow it and to make it bigger and to really raise some money for some foundations and things that I'm involved with. This is just the first step, bringing the community together with something that everyone grew up playing.\"  Pierce reacted with incredulity when asked if he expected any dispense any trash talk at his opponents.  \"Yeah! That's the whole deal! But I expect to receive it if it goes the other way, too.\"  The tournament, however, was won by one of the quietest twosomes. Jackie and Juanita Smith, a husband-and-wife pair who have been married for over forty years. They took home the top prize, which included a trophy, courtside tickets, a pair of customized jerseys and a pair of Peachtree Collection Jackets.  Graham admired their skill and cohesion.  \"I can tell that they knew each other's mannerisms. They knew what each other hand in their hands without even saying a word. It's great to see someone play the game of\u00a0Spades\u00a0the way they played it. It's a game that I love and grew up playing, and to see a different level of how they played it was great to see.\" "}

Emory Healthcare, the most comprehensive health system in Georgia and the official health care provider of the Atlanta Hawks, employs over 1,000 frontline workers rising to the occasion in caring for COVID-19 patients while improving lives and providing hope for the Atlanta community. Principal Owners Tony Ressler and Jami Gertz, Hawks President of Basketball Operations Travis Schlenk, Head Coach Lloyd Pierce, members of the team and Atlanta natives and music/entertainment icons 2 Chainz, Killer Mike and Quavo shared their appreciation for Atlanta\u2019s Healthcare Heroes here. \u201cThe work of the medical community in combatting COVID-19 across the nation has been inspiring and absolutely incredible. While there is no way to truly repay our doctors, nurses, first responders and other healthcare workers for making this sacrifice and taking the risks they are taking every day, this effort is an important way to show our great appreciation of their heroic work on behalf of the city of Atlanta,\u201d said Principal Owner Tony Ressler. \u201cWe are also proud that this program will aid our friends in the restaurant community, allowing many Atlantans in the food industry to keep or regain employment during this difficult time.\u201d With frontline caregivers being asked to work longer shifts and hospitals nearing capacity, the Hawks Foundation and State Farm are funding the preparation of 4,000 meals weekly to serve approximately 1,000 healthcare workers restaurant-quality, nutritious meals that serve two five times a week. \u201cWe\u2019re humbled and honored to have the opportunity to help feed those who are on the front lines of this fight, as well as support our communities by providing business to local restaurants and establishments in this unprecedented time,\u201d said Dan Krause, Senior Vice President, State Farm. \u201cThe essence of our business is to be a good neighbor and help people. It\u2019s the ideal upon which we were founded, and it\u2019s who we are at our core.\u201d Six Emory Healthcare hospital locations will receive meals for care team members treating those suffering from COVID-19 symptoms. \u201cWe are so grateful for the amazing community support from the Hawks, State Farm, Miller Union and Storico Fresco /Forza restaurants, and locally-sourced farms to provide our front-line health care workers with nutritious meals to take home at the end of their shifts,\u201d says Jonathan S. Lewin, MD, president and CEO of Emory Healthcare. \u201cThis act of kindness will go very far with our employees who are caring for patients with COVID-19 in our hospitals. We thank everyone for this terrific partnership.\u201d Meals are being prepared by two local Atlanta restaurants: Forza Storico, a traditional Roman restaurant by the owners of Storico Fresco, and Miller Union, a Southern restaurant co-owned by James Beard award-winning chef Steven Satterfield. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and current regulations to prevent the spreading of the virus, both restaurants, like many others in the Atlanta community, were temporarily closed and forced to lay off staff. \u201cMiller Union is really proud to be a part of the Atlanta Healthcare Heroes project with the Atlanta Hawks, State Farm and Emory Healthcare.\u00a0 It allows us to keep some of our staff on payroll during incredibly uncertain times, by making nutritious, restaurant-quality meals for healthcare workers and help support local farmers, who are definitely feeling the effects of the COVID-19 crisis as well.\u00a0 But the best part is knowing that we are making a difference in the lives of the frontline healthcare workers that are risking their lives to save others and sending them home with the gift of good food,\u201d says co-owner of Miller Union Steven Satterfield. With the multi-week meal preparation program for Healthcare Heroes, both restaurants will be able to re-employ their respective staffs and provide sustainable work for multiple farmers, ranchers and bakers that provide the ingredients. \u201cThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry is astounding. We are forever grateful for the support of the Hawks Foundation and State Farm to allow us to operate during this trying time. We are honored to serve the medical workers caring for our community,\u201d says Mike Patrick, executive chef at Forza Storico. The meal deliveries will begin today and will take place for the next four weeks. The innovative multi-week meal program is expected to be expanded in the near future, potentially providing a significant boost to the Atlanta restaurant economy while continuing to serve the healthcare community throughout greater Atlanta. \u201cIn this extremely stressful time for so many in the health field, we hope that by delivering a quality, nutritious meal we can provide a bit of relief, give them one less thing to worry about and remind them that we care about them and appreciate all that they are doing for Atlanta. The fact that we can help great Atlanta restaurants re-hire staff and keep their local suppliers in business is a powerful benefit that also helps the community,\u201d said Atlanta Hawks &amp; State Farm Arena CEO Steve Koonin.

{"team": "hawks", "url": "https://www.nba.com/hawks/features/trae-young-and-3-point-contest", "date": "2020-02-15 00:00:00", "tags": ["Young, Trae", "Hawks", "allstar"], "article": " ATLANTA - Trae Young began his All-Star Weekend with a win in the Rising Stars game, and he will conclude it Sunday with his first All-Star appearance, but in between, he will try to win a Three-Point Contest trophy to bring back to Atlanta. When he takes the court tonight, Trae will be the first Hawk to participate in the event since Kyle Korver in 2015. On the cusp of his debut, here are three stats to keep in mind with respect to Trae's three-point shooting. 1) Trae has made a lot of super-long threes. The rules of the event have changed for this year's contest. In essence, the players will take two extra shots each round and have ten extra seconds to complete the round. Those extra shots, however, will be attempted from a distance of 29 feet, 9 inches. As highlight reels and social media will attest, Trae is more than capable of making those super-long shots. The stats agree too. Last season, Trae led the NBA in shots of 30 or more feet, and this season, his 25 threes from that distance trails only Damian Lillard (43). Anything can happen in a two-shot sample, but recent history tells us that Trae is as qualified as anyone to be taking shots from logo distance. 2) Trae has made threes at a breakneck pace. Trae's NBA career to this point has consisted of 131 games. In those 131 games, Trae has made 329 threes. No one \u2013 not Korver, not Ray Allen, not Damian Lillard, and not even Steph Curry \u2013 made a greater number of threes in the first 131 games of their career. 3) Trae has been marvelously accurate on catch-and-shoot threes this season. The NBA tracks shot data in a number of ways, including by the number of dribbles taken before the shot. When Trae shoots threes on the catch after taking zero dribbles, he has been deadly accurate, making 47.6 percent of his attempts. The other competitors in the contest are quite remarkable in their own right, but Trae leads them all in accuracy on three-point attempts after zero dribbles. Duncan Robinson\u00a0 44.7 percent Davis Bertans\u00a0 43.1 percent Joe Harris\u00a0 43.0 percent Zach LaVine\u00a0 41.1 percent Devonte' Graham\u00a0 40.7 percent Buddy Hield\u00a0 39.4 percent Devin Booker\u00a0 38.2 percent While it's not an exact match, the three-point contest mirrors the catch-and-shoot technique because shooters will be pulling the balls off the rack and shooting without a dribble. It will be interesting to see if that skill carries over tonight, and if it does, Trae will become the first-ever Hawk to win the event. "}

From Atlanta's deeply rooted history being at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement, to putting southern hip-hop on the map, this city arguably sets trends and leads cultural movements.\u00a0With so much history, cultural impact and influence, there's a lot to be said about the city known as the \"Dirty South.\" Atlanta has turned into a transplant city with people from all over, including every single player on our roster. Mid-season Hawks addition Jeff Teague is no stranger to the city he spent the first eight years of his career in, but all fifteen of his teammates don\u2019t have that same history with Atlanta. So, Head Coach Lloyd Pierce felt it was necessary to show his players around the city that they play for. \u201cYou guys represent the city of Atlanta from a basketball standpoint, but you have to understand what greatness looks like, what it feels like and how to surround yourself with it,\u201d Coach Pierce said. \u201cDay in the A\u201d\u00a0is what Coach Pierce called the outing that spanned until the midafternoon the day after MLK Day. Stop one: the highly trafficked Outkast mural and neighboring sneaker store, Wish Atlanta in Little Five Points. The team and coaching staff stepped off the charter bus into the 30-degree weather bundled up in hoodies and beanies. The mural, which features the iconic Grammy award-winning hip-hop duo Outkast, was unveiled late October of last year and has become a major attraction in Little Five Points. Painted by an artist by the name JEKS, the 30-foot mural is based on photos taken by portrait photographer Jonathan Mannion. As the players made their way through the vacated lot, there were a few special guests waiting for them. Entrepreneur, activist and friend of the Hawks franchise, Killer Mike, along with Khujo, member of the iconic hip-hop group Goodie Mob. Killer Mike gave a background of his upringing in Atlanta and expressed his love for what he believes to be the greatest city for black people to thrive in, invest their money in and live in. \u201cI want you guys to seriously go home and not think \u2018hey man I just went and saw an Outkast mural,\u2019 I saw the beginning of a business empire,\u201d Killer Mike said. Coach Pierce then talked about his personal love for hip-hop and introduced Khujo who shared his history with the city and his ties with Goodie Mob. \u201c\u2026Wherever you play, understand the history of the city,\u201d Vince said. \u201cWhen you do that, I think you have a greater appreciation for what it says on your jersey and the people that\u2019s in the stands supporting you.\u201d After the players\u2019 Atlanta hip-hop crash course, they gathered for photos in front of the mural and broke off to take individual ones with each other, Killer Mike, Khujo and team owner Grant Hill. The team piled back onto the white charter bus and headed to stop number two, a few minutes down the street. Since the team recently honored the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at their game the day before, it was only right to continue honoring him by visiting The King Center for stop number two. The players explored the museum at their own pace, taking photos, reading historical information and watching videos before joining back together in the theatre. Before leaving the museum, the park ranger gave the team a preview of what they were going to see at Ebenezer Baptist Church and then at Dr. King\u2019s childhood home. As the players made their way up the red carpeted stairs at Ebenezer, many ducking through the entryway, the floors creaked and cracked as the players sporadically filled in the pews of the church that Dr. King served as the co-pastor of from 1960 until his death in 1968. After learning about the history of Ebenezer, the team headed to Dr. King\u2019s burial site where they spent time briefly and then made their way to the home where Dr. King spent the first 12 years of his childhood. The park ranger shared interesting facts about Dr. King\u2019s birth home, one being that his father paid just $3,500 for the home with only a $500 down payment. The sidewalk in front of the home and all along the street are actually the original sidewalks from the 1930s. And, surprisingly, there are people who live in the neighboring homes. Photos weren\u2019t allowed inside the house, but the players were able to walk through both levels and saw all of the rooms, which still had some original King-owned furniture pieces. The team exited the house through the spacious backyard and loaded back on the bus for lunch at their last and final stop. When the charter bus arrived at Pinky Cole\u2019s restaurant in Westview, the players were enthusiastically greeted by Cole\u2019s staff as they grabbed their plant-based burgers. The popular restaurant, known to have hour-long waits and lines down the street, closed its doors to the public to give Hawks players an intimate and uninterrupted experience. Once everyone had their food, it was time for one last group photo. A few players too hungry to wait, had their burgers in hand as the media snapped photos to close coach Pierce\u2019s educational, yet fun \u201cDay in the A.\u201d "}

Young, who also participated in the 2019 Rising Stars, will start the NBA All-Star Game two days later after leading all Eastern Conference guards in fan votes. Young has appeared in 44 games this season, all starts, and has averaged 29.4 points (third in the NBA), 9.2 assists (second in the NBA), 4.6 rebounds and 1.2 steals per contest. The No. 5 overall selection in the 2018 NBA Draft, Young leads his draft class in total points (1,295) and points per game, total assists (406) and assists per game, and total free-throws made (330) and free-throws made per game (7.5) in 2019-20. Young saw action in 13 games in January and posted 31.7 points, 11.5 assists and 5.3 rebounds per contest. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, he became the first player in 54 years (Oscar Robertson, February 1966) to meet those minimums in any month with at least 10 games played.\u00a0In his last five games of the month, Young averaged 34.0 points and 15.2 assists per game, joining Nate Archibald (1972) as the only second-year players in NBA history to average at least 30 points and 15 assists over a five-game span. Per Elias, Young\u2019s 29.4 points per game would be most for a second-year player since Bob McAdoo scored 30.6 points per game in the 1973-74 season and would make him just the third player in NBA history to average at least 29 points per game before turning 22 years old (LeBron James, 31.4 ppg, 2005-06; Kevin Durant, 30.1 ppg, 2009-10). The University of Oklahoma product has recorded 11 games this season with at least 30 points and 10 assists, the most in the Eastern Conference and the second-most in the NBA. His eight 40-point games are the most in the conference. On Jan. 8 vs. Houston, Young recorded the first 40-point triple-double in Hawks history, posting 42 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in 39 minutes. Per Elias, Young became the youngest player (21 years, 111 days) in NBA history to meet those minimums (previously Oscar Robertson at 21 years, 357 days). Young is joined on the U.S. Team by Charlotte Hornets forwards Miles Bridges and PJ Washington and guard Devonte\u2019 Graham; Chicago Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr.; Miami Heat guards Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn; Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and guard Ja Morant; and Golden State Warriors forward Eric Paschall. NBA assistant coaches selected the Rising Stars rosters, with each of the league\u2019s 30 teams submitting one ballot per coaching staff.\u00a0 A ballot consisted of four frontcourt players, four guards and two additional players at either position group for each team.\u00a0 Voters also had to choose a minimum of three first-year NBA players and three second-year NBA players for each team.\u00a0 Coaches were not permitted to vote for any player on their team. Young will become the second Hawks player in as many seasons to play in back-to-back Rising Stars, joining John Collins. "}

Chouinard Follow K.L. on Twitter at @klchouinard ATLANTA - Trae Young gave his mom an extra-long hug after his pregame shooting session. Lloyd Pierce remembered his late cousin. Vince Carter wiped away tears during the National Anthem. Sunday was a difficult day to play a basketball game as NBA players and coaches, like millions around the world, mourned the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi following a helicopter crash in California. Vince Carter, who met 15-year-old Kobe when they were AAU teammates, took note of the reactions of his teammates, many of whom were too young to remember the first half of Kobe's career. \"Obviously, he is a hero of a lot of them,\" Carter said. \"To see the blank stares on their faces brought a somber mood to the locker room. Very little was talked about \u2013 game-planning or basketball \u2013 because it was bigger than basketball.\" In his pregame press conference, head coach Lloyd Pierce paid homage to the professional and personal sides of Kobe. \"I grew up on the West Coast. I was a Laker fan as a child. I had to denounce being a Laker fan once you get into the profession. But I've always respected his greatness, because of his detail and his passion and the intensity with which he plays. But there's nothing more than the respect I have for him as a father. Every image you see of him post-retirement is with his daughters, with his family. Everything you see online, on Twitter is about positivity. He is encouraging others. And I think it has been the biggest transformation of a competitor to a human being that I've ever seen.\" The passing of an NBA legend hit a lot of people in a lot of deeply personal ways, Pierce included. \u201cForgive me for being emotional,\u201d he said before sharing a story about the loss of his cousin, a Navy pilot stationed in San Diego, in a helicopter crash in 1998, Pierce's senior year of college. \u201cI still have a hard time looking at helicopters. There are just certain things you don\u2019t get over. Today is that day.\u201d It was a somber day for so many in the building. Collins met Kobe personally this summer for the first time at a special summer training session for select NBA players. He said it was an inspiration that he will never forget. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t want to play today,\" John Collins said. \"I\u2019ve got a Fathead of him on my wall, I\u2019ve got jerseys of his, pictures, I could go on for days. We look at him as our generation\u2019s (Michael) Jordan, at least for me. I'm praying for his family, his loved ones and everything surrounding the situation.\u201d Bruno Fernando, who lost his mother this month and who wears jersey #24, started at center. He set career highs in both points (14) and rebounds (12), and he notched his first career double-double. Owners Tony Ressler and Jami Gertz started their family in Los Angeles before they purchased the Hawks. \"Our family was (Lakers) season-ticket holders for 28 years,\" Gertz said before the game. \"Watching Kobe play was one of the biggest reasons that we wanted to buy an NBA franchise. He made us love basketball.\" The one person in the arena with perhaps the biggest burden to shoulder was Trae Young. Trae idolized Kobe, but Gigi idolized Trae. Two of the small handful of games that the Bryants attended this season were Hawks games. Gigi wanted to see Trae play. Trae met with them after both games. \"His daughter was a big fan of mine, and he was always trying to figure out new ways to help his kids learn,\" Trae said. \"He found out that I worked with my trainer, Alex Bazzell, so he got in contact with him. Gigi started working out with Alex Bazzell. That's how me and Kobe got introduced \u2013 it was through my trainer.\" At the start of the game, Trae took off his warmups to reveal jersey #8. The Hawks and Wizards took intentional 8-second and 24-second violations at the start of game to pay tribute to the two jersey numbers that Kobe wore over the duration of his NBA career. The Hawks called timeout, and Trae switched back into his usual jersey #11. In a fitting tribute to Kobe, a player who saved his best shows for the biggest stages, Trae played an electric game. He scored 45 points. He handed out 14 assists to his teammates, many of which either started as no-look passes or ended as thunderous alley-oops. If there was any doubt that something special was happening, Trae stole a full-court pass with two seconds left in the first half, calmly stepped in the direction of the basket and dropped in a heave from beyond half court. Trae tapped his chest and pointed to the sky. Trae described the play after the game. \"I said, 'Kobe was with me.'\" Gigi was certainly there, too. Carter, the Hawk who knew Kobe best and certainly the one who knew Kobe the longest, took solace in what he saw from Kobe on the sidelines of games in recent years and what he heard when he spoke with him. \"It wasn't the Mamba competing against whoever. It was Dad teaching his daughter the ins and outs of the game, and how he sees it, and how she can learn to break the game down. That's what I saw and I think that is what a lot of people could see and I think that's what catches the basketball world off guard more than anything because we all saw it.\" \"For those of us who played against him and knew him, that was what was gut-wrenching more than anything because of his happiness, because of that conversation I had with him. He was telling me, 'I'm at peace. I'm happy. I'm at my happiest.' All these championships that he won, MVPs, 81 (points) \u2013 he was at his happiest in retirement.\" Rest in peace, Kobe, and be at your happiest. "}

With Trae Young out with a right thigh contusion, Collins took over as the singular focal point of the Hawks and delivered a sizzling performance: 33 points, 16 rebounds, 3 steals, 1 block.  Collins was The Rock after the game, too. As he spoke to reporters in the locker room, Kevin Huerter suggested that Collins was sporting a familiar style.  .@KevinHuerter compared @jcollins20_ to @TheRock and it was GLORIOUS. pic.twitter.com/I1qbOM6HLU \u2014 FOX Sports: Hawks (@HawksOnFSSE) January 23, 2020 More should be said of Collins' success against the Clippers, and after a normal game, Collins would wrestle away all the headlines. For the Hawks, though, this wasn't a typical game. The Hawks don't usually win after falling behind by 21 points. They don't usually win on nights when they shoot 35 percent from the field. And if that's not enough, the Clippers topped the Hawks by a 150-101 margin just two months ago.  The Hawks come back to beat the Clippers after trailing by 19 at half. It's the 2nd-largest halftime comeback for the @ATLHawks since moving to Atlanta and it's tied for the largest blown lead at half in Clippers history. pic.twitter.com/RN3Y6fjkzp \u2014 ESPN Stats &amp; Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 23, 2020   The Hawks did win this game, though, and they won it, in large part, because the team brought a overwhelming amount of get-up-and-go to their second-half performance. Two of the Hawks' energy players \u2013 Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin \u2013 led that charge in encouraging fashion.  Fernando\u00a0scored six points and grabbed a career-high nine rebounds, but his work on the glass went beyond those nine rebounds. He played a\u00a0vital role in occupying Clipper rebounders when the Hawks shots went up. The Clippers boxed him out with one, sometimes two defenders, and Fernando often kept the ball alive so that his teammates could grab it.  \"They're a really good offensive rebounding team,\" Fernando said of the Clippers afterward, \"so we were just trying to hit them with the same thing that they hit us with.\"  The Hawks did all of that and then some. They posted season-highs with 63 rebounds and 23 offensive rebounds. As a result of their work on the glass, the Hawks took 102 shots for the game. The Clippers took just 78. On a night when the shot-making wasn't perfect, the Hawks made up for it by simply getting more shots.  While Fernando battled on the boards, Brandon Goodwin orchestrated the offense and the defense.  Because Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were out for the Clippers, Lou Williams became the center of their offense. It was Goodwin's task to slow him. With the Clippers playing their second game in two nights, Lloyd Pierce called on Goodwin to apply full-court pressure in an effort to wear down Williams and the Clippers. The result? A head-to-head battle of local, former metro-Atlanta prep stars.  In the end, Norcross' Goodwin came out on top over Williams, the pride of South Gwinnett. While helping hold Williams to 3-for-10 shooting in the fourth quarter, Goodwin also scored 19 points on a mix of pull-up threes and dashing drives. He came within a basket of outscoring the entire Clipper team (20 points) in the final frame.  Lou-Will had hearty praise ready for his fellow Georgian after the game.  \"I thought he single-handedly changed the energy, changed the momentum of the game tonight and went and got that win for them.\u201d  If Goodwin is lucky, he will continue to grow and taste some of the success that Williams has had as an NBA pro. On this night, he took one huge step in that direction. "}

Chouinard Follow K.L. on Twitter at @klchouinard 1) Trae Young is a star. Let's start with a premise embedded in the name itself. The event is the\u00a0All-Star\u00a0Game, the game with all of the stars. Trae Young is a no-doubt star, a player who moves the needle. He is (and has been for quite some time) a player who people want to watch. As he showed on this play, Trae is always a threat to make a rare play, something unexpected and breathtaking at the same time. The person who spots the Shammgod and the hesitation dribble appreciates it. Little kids appreciate it. Great-grandmas appreciate it. Trae is a treat for all ages and audiences. Trae is a star. His highlights are a viral content machine. He should be in a game with all of his fellow A-list NBA players. On the other hand, even if we set star-quality aside, Trae should still rank as a lock as one of the 12 best players in the Eastern Conference. 2) Trae leads the Eastern Conference in assists. Through games played Jan. 16, Trae leads the Eastern Conference with 8.5 assists per game and he ranks fourth overall for the whole league. If the theoretical argument against Trae's All-Star appearance goes something like, \"the Hawks don't have a ton of wins therefore Trae doesn't do enough to make his team better\", the folks making that case have either missed the point or not watched the Hawks play. Trae constantly draws extra attention and extra defenders, and as a result, his teammates are more open and in a better situation to score when he gives them the ball. 3) The Hawks have been much more efficient with Trae on the court. When one compares the Hawks' offense with and without Trae on the court, the Hawks have been 17.4 points per 100 possessions better with Trae in the game. Whenever he has the ball in his hands, Trae is a threat to drive, shoot, pass or draw free throws. Defenses cannot take away all of those options. They have to pick and choose. At that point, it's Trae's call to make as far as where the ball should go and he usually makes the right call. 4) Trae ranks second in the East in points. Trae has averaged 29.2 points per game this season. He trails the only player in front of him in the Eastern Conference, Giannis Antetokounmpo, by less than a point per\u00a0game (30.1). Antetokounmpo\u00a0is the reigning MVP. When you've outscored everyone in your conference but the reigning MVP, you deserve to be in the All-Star Game. 4b) Trae is in select company. If Trae keeps up the pace, he'll be the second player in NBA history to average 29 points and 8 assists per game in his second season.\u00a012-time All-Star Oscar Robertson was the first. 5)\u00a0Stretching defenses to the limit. In the 2010-11 season, Kyle Lowry led the NBA in shots made from 28+ feet. Lowry made six shots from that distance that season (data from\u00a0basketballreference.com). Last season, Steph Curry made 62 shots from 28+ feet, the greatest number since the NBA began tracking shot distances in 2000-01. (Trae finished second behind Curry). At the halfway point of this season, Trae has made 41 shots from 28 feet and beyond. These shots have value. They increase the amount of distance that defenses have to cover. They make teams chase over screens instead of ducking under them. And, of course, they count for three points instead of two. Trae is not just knocking down a high volume of these shots. He is also converting them at an unthinkable 40.2 percent clip. The touch, coordination and feel for the game that it takes to make these kinds of shots should not be underestimated. If it was in any way an easy thing to do, other NBA players would have done it. 6) Trae has honed his craft. The long shots aren't the end of the story. Trae's shotmaking across all levels has gotten better. His floater, already really good last season, has improved. His finishing around the rim is up. Perhaps most noticeably, his three-point shotmaking out of the pick and roll has improved. Like the ultra-long threes, these shots are difficult. Defenders lurk in multiple spots. Balance is precarious because you're moving in a direction that isn't toward the basket. Trae makes these shots anyway and with enough precision that defenses put themselves in compromising positions with trapping and blitzing schemes because they need to commit two defenders to him. \"I worked a lot on that this summer and even through the year, just coming off the screen and being ready to shoot off the screen,\" Young said. \"I didn't do a lot of that last year (when) it was more coming off screens and hitting the pop guy or shooting floaters.\" \"For me, now there are some teams that sit their big man way back in the paint. If our big man hits the guy guarding me, then I'm able to get off the pick and I have a wide-open three if I work on it. And I did a lot of that this summer.\" Trae's summer workout schedule was not one for the faint of heart. \"In the summer I got back to my three-a-days. I get a workout early in the morning on the court. It will be a hard workout. It will be a lot of ballhandling and shots off the pick-and-roll. Then I get a lift in around 2:00 or 2:30. Then I'll go eat and rest up. And then at nighttime, I'll find a gym around 7:30 or 8:00 and then just get shots up. That's not necessarily a hard (workout), it's just more touch and coming out and getting my deep shots up.\" That's really the key for Trae. His touch is better than last year, and describing his touch as 'better' is an understatement. He's playing basketball in a way that is virtually unprecedented. His ball skills are phenomenal. His shooting range goes as deep as anyone in NBA history. In a way, to finish where we started, being a prodigy and a star and a social media phenom works against Trae. The folks who see Trae's highlights and look at the Hawks record without watching actual Hawks games assume that those highlights are coming as a product of a hit-or-miss style of play. That's not what Trae is doing. He is changing the way basketball is being played, he has put the work in to get to a skill level that allows for that style of play and he deserves to be in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. He deserves it, and the fans who watch the game deserve to see him, too. Don't forget to vote for Trae Young HERE. You have until 11:59 p.m. Monday, January 20! "}

Chouinard Follow K.L. on Twitter: @KLChouinard At one point early this season, head coach Lloyd Pierce joked with Bruno Fernando that every time Fernando shared the court with Kevin Huerter, Huerter tried to get a pass to his former Maryland teammate. Conventional wisdom says that inside every joke there is a little kernel of truth. Huerter and Fernando\u00a0do\u00a0seem to have a mutual comfort level, and it would be reasonable to attribute that comfort to their season together as Maryland Terrapins. Huerter has assisted on six of Fernando's field goals this year; only point guard Trae Young has assisted Fernando more often. On the other hand, Huerter's playmaking has been a productive source of offense for the Hawks and Fernando isn't the only teammate who has benefitted. Since Huerter returned from a shoulder injury on Dec. 4, he has been the most constant presence as a facilitator in the Hawks' offense when Young goes to the bench. It goes without saying that Young has propelled the team's offense this season: his 8.5 assists per game rank fifth\u00a0in the NBA for 2019-20. And because of Young's stamina (35.6 minutes per game), the Hawks have not relied on a backup point guard as much as some teams do, but they still do require someone to spell Young \u2013 and fill his considerable shoes when he misses time with injury as he has over the past week. Huerter has led the charge of a point-guard-by-committee approach that has also featured Cam Reddish, Evan Turner, DeAndre' Bembry, and more recently Brandon Goodwin. \"We don't have a quote-unquote natural backup point guard on our roster,\" Pierce said. \"Trae is our point guard, and then we've done it by committee. That's a position that we talked about last year with Kevin: getting him the ball a little more and allowing him to play that backup point spot.\" Huerter got his feet wet as an NBA playmaker last season, and his usage in that role gradually increased in the later months of his rookie campaign. For the season, Huerter finished second on the team with 214 total assists. \"We always\u00a0talk about Kevin as a shooter, but the thing we missed the most is his ability to facilitate,\" Pierce said. \"And that helps us because you can move Trae off the basketball and he can get some cleaner looks as well. Now you're playing pick and roll without the blitz and Trae is off the basketball. That combination is going to help us out.\" As mentioned earlier, the Hawks' offense has produced well with Young on the floor. The tricky part has been keeping things going when he goes to the bench. Over the course of the season, in those minutes when Young is not on the court, the Hawks have scored much better with Huerter in the mix: the offense has been\u00a0+12.8 points per 100 possessions better with Kevin than without him (stats from\u00a0NBA WOWY). The ways in which Huerter is empowered as a facilitator varies. At times, he'll bring the ball up the floor and begin his work there. At other times, one of the other ballhandlers may bring the ball up, while Huerter starts in the corner, curls around a screen to the top of the key, and begins a downhill descent toward the rim. Either way, the Hawks need the ball in his hands for his ability to set teammates up in beneficial spots. This season, Huerter again ranks second on the team in total assists (78), and he has notched two season-high scoring efforts in the past ten days: 19 points against both Cleveland and Orlando. Huerter's scoring ability keeps teams honest: defenses cannot play under a pick when he has the ball, and as a result, he can get defenses into rotation with enough regularity that teammates pop open and good things happen. Huerter has point guard experience in his background. \"I did all of high school, 9th through 12th grade and even growing up, I was always a point guard,\" Huerter said. \"Maryland was kind of similar to here, just trying to find ways to get the ball in my hands but I played with a point guard. And obviously up here, it has kind of been off and on (the ball) a little bit.\" The Hawks will need Huerter to slide back and forth between guard spots this season, but in either position, Huerter has the shooting, vision and ball skills to make good things happen for both him and his teammates.

On a sputtering possession with the shot clock winding down, Cam Reddish sprinted out of the corner, took a pass at the elbow, got his feet planted with a jump-shooter's rhythm, and shot a balanced three with a graceful follow-through. He missed. For Reddish, though, the beautiful part is what happened next. His shoulders didn't slump. He didn't doubt himself. And he zipped back on defense with a pep in his step. How did that confidence pay off? Reddish scored 10 points in the next two minutes. He hit a three on a curl that mirrored his previous miss. After corralling an offensive rebound, he stepped into a pullup 20-footer. Then he summoned 'oohs' and 'aahs' from the crowd at State Farm Arena with a pair of fast-break layups, both of which he finished with powerful step-through moves. While the scoring outburst wasn't enough to pull the Hawks to a win, Reddish's career-high 25 points certainly showed what the 20-year-old can do when he plays with the momentum of a few early confidence-building moments. \u201cI was just in it tonight,\" Reddish said after the game. \"I was feeling it from the jump when I hit my first two. I was just feeling confident throughout the entire game. My teammates were finding me for open shots and I was able to knock them down.\u201d Head coach Lloyd Pierce echoed the same sentiment. \u201cHe scored his first five points on the first two shots and I think that helps with any player to see the ball go in the basket, to feel good about it. That was the best part: that it was from start to finish. There was really no drop off in terms of his aggression in his shot making. His points came in bunches and they came at different periods of the game, and for him to play consistently and score consistently all night was most impressive.\" For the season, Reddish is averaging 8.1 points and 3.7 rebounds per game while playing around 25 minutes per game. His previous career high was 17 points two weeks ago against an outstanding Milwaukee Bucks team. On a lot of nights, his rangy and effective perimeter defense is his best contribution. And while he had 3 steals against the Nets, the scoring outbursts that cropped up in multiple quarters were what stood out most. To smooth over the bumps of a rookie season, Reddish has been studying extra film with the coaches. He noted that the film has helped him slow down some of the plays on which he used to rush, while also helping him identify the spots where he can best find openings to score. Reddish has also been going back to the practice court at the Emory Sports Medicine Complex at night for some extra individual work with assistant coach Melvin Hunt. \"After practice, I go home and play with my dog a little bit and chill. Then I try to go back later that night and try to get some more shots up. I've been focusing on my balance \u2013 holding my follow-through and trying to be super detailed on my jump shot.\" The additional attention to detail is paying off with improved footwork and results, and Reddish is poised to show why the team believes he can become an effective two-way player sooner than later.

Ordinarily, a rookie setting a career high in his 17th NBA game would not fall far from the ordinary pattern of things. With the small base of games, it's perfectly normal \u2013 even expected \u2013 for a rookie to hit his high-water mark in points. For Fernando, though, the achievement stood out because he managed the feat after a terrific feat of endurance: he was playing his fourth game in four days.  To be clear, the NBA did not assign the Hawks a diabolical turn of schedule. Three of Fernando's games came with the Hawks: Friday night on the road against the Detroit Pistons, plus Saturday and Monday nights at home in State Farm Arena. Fernando picked up the fourth game through an assignment to the College Park Skyhawks, where he contributed to the Bayhawks' win with 9 points and 9 rebounds in 30 minutes.  Sunday's catch? It was a day game. After finding out at 10:30 PM Saturday that he would be getting a stint with the Hawks' G League affiliate, Fernando was up early to prep for a 2:00 PM tip.  \"I was up at 8:00,\" Fernando said, \"they picked me up at 9:45 and I was there at 10:30 and we did a walk-through on the court.\"  Luckily for Fernando, he knew most of what he needed to know before the arrived at Gateway Center Arena. He played with a number of the Bayhawks in Summer League, and other than a few sideline and baseline out-of-bounds plays, the two teams run most of the same sets.  \"I feel it more so today than anything,\" Fernando said Tuesday morning after the four-game burst. I'm not extremely tired \u2013 like exhausted \u2013 but it's that feeling where my legs hit me a little bit today.\"  Then Fernando smiled and reversed course.  \"If I had a game, I would be able to play.\"  Fernando credited a rigorous devotion to stretching for helping him recover quickly enough for each game, and he said that he had not played four games in four days since his AAU days.  \"And even then,\" he added, \"the intensity was nothing like it is here.\"  That intensity level is what head coach Lloyd Pierce sees as the biggest adjustment as Fernando adapts to the NBA game.  \"The speed of the game is probably the biggest challenge for him,\" Pierce said. \"He has been a big, physical, featured played at the collegiate level. And he's a big, physical, complementary player at this level, who is learning how to play against guys who are equally as big \u2013 or bigger \u2013 and a lot faster.\"  For the season, Fernando is averaging 4.7 points and 3.1 rebounds while playing a little over 12 minutes per game off the bench. In addition to his 13 points Monday, he also added 4 rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block.  \"His first half yesterday was pretty good,\" Pierce said. \"I thought he was aggressive going to the offensive glass. I thought he was physical defending (Karl-Anthony Towns) in the post. It was nice to see him make a three in the second half as well.\"  The Hawks faded in that second half, eventually losing their seventh consecutive game. The locker room was mostly a sober affair afterward, Fernando included. But when asked whether he would need the day off that Pierce had promised, Fernando rejected the idea with a note of levity.  \"I feel great. I'm only 21!\"  True to his word, Fernando practiced the following morning. "}

Chouinard Follow him on Twitter: @KLChouinard The Class of 2013 of Simeon Career Academy put on a magnificent show when the Hawks played the Miami Heat in Atlanta on Halloween. Rookie Kendrick Nunn started at guard and scored 28 points to lead the Heat. Five-year NBA veteran Jabari Parker came off the bench and grabbed eight rebounds while scoring a team-best 23 points. At Simeon, the duo combined to achieve the historic feat of winning four Illinois State Championships in four seasons from 2010 to 2013. \"That's my brother,\" Parker said of Nunn. \"We've known each other since we were 11 or 12 years old.\" Parker was quick to add a notable footnote to their high school success. He and Nunn also won gold in the two summers that they played internationally with Team USA at the FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship and FIBA World Under-17 Championship. Fifteen months after finishing that high school career, the Milwaukee Bucks drafted Parker with the No. 2 overall pick of the 2014. Along with Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had just finished a promising rookie season, the Bucks had twin beacons of hope for a frustrated fanbase that had not seen their team win a playoff series in 13 years. In the five years that followed that draft, Antetokounmpo made the meteoric rise from mid-first-round draft pick to NBA MVP. Parker tore the ACL in his left knee during a promising rookie season, clawed his way back to play 76 games a season later, then tore the same ACL three-quarters of the way through his third NBA season, one in which he was averaging over 20 points per game. \"You know what?\" Parker said philosophically of his former teammate. \"To see him from Day 1 transform into the person who he is today is a blessing, because I can tell my kids and my program about what it takes in dedication to become the MVP of this league \u2013 and it's a guy that I know. Those memories are shared, and I had a little bit in there too that I'm grateful for. We all won at the end of the day by seeing him accomplish his goal.\" As a member of the Hawks, Jabari carries with him a legacy of Bucks practices, which at the time were held in the Cousins Center, a few hundred yards from the shore of Lake Michigan. When his teammates take the court for practice in shorts of various lengths \u2013 some with leggings, some without \u2013 Parker sports a pair of faded sweatpants that stop a few inches above the tops of his hightops. \"I've been wearing sweatpants since my rookie year in Milwaukee,\" Parker said. \"It was cold in the gym sometimes, so to layer up was very important to stay warm throughout the course of practice.\" Those sweatpants fit Parker's persona as the NBA's oldest 24-year-old. To wit, Jabari counts among his passions\u00a0vintage\u00a01960s Cadillacs and 1990s hip-hop. \"He says that he has a brother that's my age,\" head coach Lloyd Pierce said. \"Jabari listens to everything that I listen to, music-wise. In the mornings when the iPad is going, I always know when it's Jabari who is controlling it. You may hear Marvin Gaye. You may hear Biggie. You may hear Outkast. It was Big Daddy Kane the other day. I know when Jabari has the iPad and you can feel his energy.\" In fact, Darryl Parker, Jabari's oldest brother, most definitely fits in Coach Pierce's age bracket. When Darryl was playing college basketball at the University of Oregon and Pierce was at the University of Santa Clara, they once played in a game against each other. Santa Clara won, thanks in large part to Steve Nash's 34 points. The story flips when Jabari takes the court. The graybeard stuff drops by the wayside when he uses his incredible skill, bounce and athleticism to finish around the rim. Through games played Saturday, Parker had taken 85 of his 93 shot attempts in the form of threes or shots within five feet of the rim \u2013 the shots that Pierce uses as a rough measuring stick of how successful his offense has been. The ones around the rim are where Jabari has thrived most. He has made 41 of 55 shots (74.5 percent), a mark that puts him in elite company among NBA finishers. And his 25 dunks ranked him fourth in the league behind only perennial dunk-masters Clint Capela, Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis. Parker's value to the Hawks goes beyond his ability to put the ball in the hoop from close range. Of all the front-court players on the team, Jabari has the best handle on drives and that particular skill has immense utility in situations where Trae Young faces pick-and-roll traps and other double team situations. \"I'm definitely trying to look for a lane, especially when Trae frees up the court so much like that creating doubles,\" Parker said. \"It's going to be important for everyone else to be aggressive.\" Parker counts Young among the best point guards with whom he has played, alongside Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine and Eric Bledsoe. Parker only got to play with Bledsoe for one season, and with Beal and LaVine for parts of the same one season, and he didn't get to play with any of those players during his first three NBA campaigns. Playing with Trae should only help his immense scoring gifts. On the other side of the ball, Pierce said that Parker has learned the defense, but the next step is to vocalize it and make plays once the scheme becomes instinctive. \"His biggest thing is using his voice,\" Pierce said. \"He knows where he is supposed to be; he is in the right area. If you know your defense, you talk your defense. He is still not sure of, 'Am I saying 'switch'? Am I saying, 'Get over'?' He is in the right spot. He is trying to do the right thing now, where the next step is to not just do the right thing, but to make a play.\" For the season, Parker is averaging 16.4 points and five rebounds per game in 25.5 minutes, while shooting 57.0 percent from the field. For his career, Parker is one of a handful of active NBA guards and forwards to average 15 or more points per game while shooting 47.5 percent from the field or better (min. 200 games played). The others are LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin and, of course, Parker's old running mate, Antetokounmpo. Jabari Parker makes it easy to forget that he is just 24 years old. He has done a lot in his NBA career, especially in light of the hurdles thrown his way. But six years into his NBA career, he still has time to do so much more. "}

Chouinard Twitter: @KLChouinard When a reporter asked Charles Barkley about the United States' first opponent in the lead-up to the 1992 Olympic Games, Barkley didn't equivocate about how his Dream Team squad would match up. \"I don't know anything about Angola, but Angola's in trouble,\" he deadpanned. Twenty-seven years later, on the cusp of becoming the first player from Angola to play in the NBA, 21-year-old Bruno Fernando \u2013 a man fiercely proud of his home country \u2013 took a pragmatic approach to analyzing the match between his countrymen and a team populated by the likes of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. \"I mean, they were in trouble,\" Fernando said with a grin. \"Obviously, it wasn't easy to play against the Dream Team. I think the competition was there. Our basketball program back there has evolved and grown so much since then.\" A 116-48 loss to the Dream Team may not have seemed like a step in the right direction, but in a sense it was. Angola qualified for that Olympics with a victory over Senegal in the 1992 FIBA Africa Championship, their second consecutive victory in an event that they came to dominate. From 1989 to 2013, Angola won 11 out of 13 African titles. Fernando earned a spot with his country's esteemed national basketball program during that era of dominance. After first picking up the sport as a tall nine-year-old, Fernando joined the Angolan junior program within five years and eventually helped the team win the 2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship. That tournament win qualified Angola for the 2014 FIBA Under-17 World Championship in Dubai. It was there that Fernando caught the eye of many basketball observers with a strong game in the paint opposite a US team that featured Jayson Tatum, Harry Giles and Josh Jackson.\u00a0Bruno scored 12 points and grabbed 13 rebounds against the eventual gold medalists, and in that performance, he paved the way to two years at top US prep schools and two seasons at the University of Maryland. Now, after being selected with the 34th pick of the 2019 NBA Draft, the challenge for the 6-foot-10 forward/center is to expand his offensive game beyond what he was able to do in college, where he averaged 13.6 points and 10.6 rebounds last season largely on the strength of what he was able to do inside. \"We feel like there was more there than you were able to see at Maryland,\" President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Travis Schlenk said at Fernando's introductory press conference. \"You're going to see him step out and shoot threes. He's going to be a good three-point shooter in this league.\" In his two seasons at Maryland, Fernando attempted just 13 threes from the shorter NCAA three-point line and made four of them. At the same time, he demonstrated a scorer's touch on midrange jump shots from 10 to 15 feet. He also made 76.3 percent of his free throws as a collegian, an outstanding overall mark and one that might indicate the ability to stretch his shooting range outward. Fernando wouldn't be the first center to add the three-point shot during Schlenk's tenure. Former Hawk Dewayne Dedmon converted 133 of 358 threes in his two seasons in Atlanta after only attempting a single three in his first four NBA seasons. Current teammate Alex Len, who also played his college ball at Maryland, made 74 of 204 threes (36.3 percent) last season \u2013 his first in Atlanta \u2013 after only converting six in his first five years as a pro. Len noted that it took time to earn the respect of opposing defenses, but once earned, the opportunities abounded in an offense centered on pick-and-roll plays run by Trae Young and John Collins. \"The bigs couldn't help on the roll and J.C. was getting wide-open dunks,\" Len said of the way teams changed their defensive coverages of him. \"If the bigs did help on the roll, it was a wide-open three for me.\" By no means is the three-point shot the only challenge facing Fernando, even if it is the one most different than what he experienced at Maryland. He must also adjust to facing off against bigger, stronger players at the NBA level. He has to figure out how to communicate with teammates in a defensive scheme that he himself is just learning. He needs to improve at defending without fouling and protecting the ball when he has possession of it in the paint. Of course, most (if not all) of these sorts of things can be said of every rookie pivot. In the five games of the preseason, small steps of growth were evident in all of these areas. Fernando finished with 16 points, 15 rebounds and 4 assists in 80 minutes played. He tied for the team lead with four blocks. Fernando also shot a sturdy 60 percent from the field in the preseason, making 5 of 7 twos and 1 of 3 threes. \"It was a good feeling. I'm not going to lie,\" Fernando said of his first professional long-distance connection. \"I was wide open. I just caught the ball and shot it. I had a lot of confidence when I took the shot, and I knew it was going in.\" If Fernando keeps making those shots, he might not be wide open for long \u2013 and that will be a good thing for both Bruno and the teammates with whom he shares the court.

The same core returns to the Hawks for the 2019-20 season and, of course, each player in the trio has an extra year of age and NBA experience in hand.  Yet somehow, even as those players matured, the Hawks are an even younger team now than they were last season.  \"Can you name our veterans?\" Head Coach Lloyd Pierce quipped in response to a question about leadership on Media Day.  How did the Hawks get younger? The key lies in the roster turnover. Only six players from the last year's Hawks return for this season. The majority of the remaining roster spots will go to younger players, including 2019 draftees\u00a0De\u2019Andre\u00a0Hunter, Cam Reddish and Bruno Fernando.  Hunter and Fernando, who were chosen with the #4 and #34 overall picks of the draft, are each 21 years old. The baby-faced Reddish just turned 20 this summer. He was chosen with the 10th pick of the draft.  A number of the team's veteran offseason acquisitions are on the younger side too. The Hawks signed Jabari Parker as a free agent over the summer, and incredibly, even though he is entering his 6th NBA season, Parker is just 24 years old.  \"(Jabari) played in a playoff series with Milwaukee,\"\u00a0President of Basketball Operations Travis Schlenk said.\u00a0\"He just brings game experience. Offensively, he is a very dynamic offensive player and a very good passer for a combo forward, which is really what he is. We're just excited just to have somebody who has got some experience but is still young.\"  Schlenk likened Parker's situation to the one Alex Len was in last season, a young-ish free agent in search of a team that could be his ideal fit. Len, Parker and recent trade acquisition Damian Jones figure to play substantial roles in the front court this season. Len is 26 years old, and Jones, who spent his first three NBA seasons with Golden State, is just 24.  Despite all the youth, Pierce does have some older heads to whom he can turn.  \"We're going to lean on Evan Turner and Vince Carter just to help out in the locker room, help on the court and help in workouts.\"  At the same time, with the roster being as young as it is, players like Huerter, Young and Collins are on the cusp of taking leadership roles in their early 20s.  \"It's important for the younger young guys to lean on some of the older young guys,\" Pierce said. \"Their limited experience is what I can rely on. They know what we want to run offensively. They have to use their voice to educate some of the other guys \u2013 not even just the young guys \u2013 but some of the other guys.\"  Is it possible that learning to teach a subject is the ultimate form of learning about it? Pierce seems to lean toward that way of thinking.  \"Sometimes when you're in that teaching mode, it forces you to be right,\" he said. \"Trae has got to be right when he calls the plays, because he knows more than the other guys. It makes him lock in a little bit more because everyone is looking to him and looking at him to be a leader. I'm hoping that experience helps him grow up a little bit faster.\"  Huerter echoed Pierce's sentiment about mentoring new faces, despite it being just his second NBA season.  \"Something Coach Pierce talked about at the end of last season is how the guys coming back \u2013 me, Trae, John, DeAndre' (Bembry) \u2013 had to take on more of that role for the new guys. We'll have nine new guys this year. A lot of us know what we do, how the team runs, know our offense, know what we're trying to do defensively \u2013 and so we have to be the guys who are out here helping people out.\"  Collins is now the second-longest tenured Hawk, with a grand total of two NBA seasons in Atlanta. It's a fact that, when presented to Collins in the context of leadership, left him with a bit of an incredulous smile on his face.  \"I don't\u00a0not\u00a0want it, but it's just something that I didn't really expect to happen this early,\" he said. \"That is one thing that Coach and I have talked about a lot is trying to take a bigger step in that leadership role. It's weird, but I'm ready to take on the challenge.\"  The timetable is slowly advancing in Atlanta, and one significant part of that march forward is for the young returning players to carve a path and lead the way.

Two young Hawks, Trae Young (#62)\u00a0and John Collins (#51) both ranked in the top 100! Check out what Rob Mahoney at SI had to say about Collins &amp; Young: screen_shot_2019-09-09_at_11.38.35_am.png  51. John Collins \"This feels like the year that John Collins enters the public consciousness. There\u2019s something in his game for everybody. Collins\u2019 high-flying dunks give him some sugar-coated pop appeal; a blooming off-the-dribble game makes him a fascinating experiment for the die-hard crowd; and the Hawks\u2019 upward momentum (along with\u00a0Collins\u2019 own Giannis-lite aspirations) make for some great narrative fodder. The main reason that the world\u00a0should\u00a0take notice is that Collins (who came within a rounding error of averaging 20 and 10) is a really good basketball player coming into his own. The reason they likely will is that he\u2019s fun as hell to watch. If there\u2019s any real sticking point, it\u2019s the depth of what we can\u2019t yet know. Evaluating any young player is difficult until we\u2019ve seen them in a postseason setting, where the cost of every limitation is made real. It\u2019s not yet clear what Collins\u2019 best position might be, or what role he could play in a high-level defense. These aren\u2019t demerits so much as caveats. Give Collins credit for thriving in the role he\u2019s had. There\u2019s just a different burden of proof where stardom is concerned, and that\u2019s the category where he\u2019ll soon find himself.\"   62. Trae Young \"Tempting as it is to move Trae Young up this list, let\u2019s start with a frank accounting of exactly what we saw from the rookie guard last season. Young was the lead playmaker for the 23rd-ranked offense; while running that offense, Young committed\u00a0more turnovers per minute\u00a0than every player in the league save for James Harden and Russell Westbrook; despite his acclaim as a shooter, Young took so many difficult threes that he shot a Mudiayan 32.4% from beyond the arc; and, in a display of lousy defense by any measure, managed to register as the worst defender in the league by defensive real plus-minus. None of this means that Young isn\u2019t a brilliant passer or a star in the making. Rather, it\u2019s a reminder that our collective response to high-achieving rookies\u2014in all their thrilling novelty\u2014can sometimes gloss over the practical realities of the sport. Part of what makes Young so interesting as a prospect is that his game is still so far from complete. He\u2019s learning what it means to run an offense at a professional level beyond hitting tough shots and making impressive passes. There is a subtlety to the job that can only be learned through working it\u2014the kind that was even discernible in Young\u2019s performance as he moved from month to month during his rookie season. Give it time. The version of Young we\u2019ll see in action in the coming season will probably play a smarter, more polished brand of basketball by some incremental measure. He\u2019ll also still be fun and flawed, without the clarity that comes through postseason scrutiny. Let\u2019s not rush to make Young more than he is: a 21-year-old who sees the game through a lens of incredible ambition, with the talent to someday (or sometimes) fulfill it.\" Read the entire Sports Illustrated article HERE "}

We got next. The focus heading into the 2019-2020 season is largely on the duo of Trae Young and John Collins, but another intriguing storyline heading into the season is the stockpile of nice, young talent on the roster. The additions of De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish in the 2019 NBA Draft compliments the young core of Young, Collins and Kevin Huerter, giving the Hawks a promising future. Also, the resurgence of Alex Len was a bright spot. To close out the season, Len averaged 15.4 points per game and shot 51.9 percent from the floor (40.4 percent from deep) while also averaging 5.9 rebounds per game in the months of March and April. Another bright spot was General Manager Travis Schlenk's ability to work trades to take as many swings at the draft as possible. \"Here\u2019s how Schlenk has done in\u00a0his three Hawks drafts: Collins, Young, Huerter and now Hunter and Reddish after swinging another Draft-day deal to get an additional pick.

Powell goes on to say, \"In a best-case scenario, then, the young core, still on rookie deals, will flourish and the Hawks will use their cap space next summer on veterans who can push the club into playoff contention. Or they can use that ample space to swing a trade for an A-list star who qualifies as a disgruntled asset -- much the way Anthony Davis, Paul George and Russell Westbrook changed teams this summer for one reason or another.\" Powell finishes how he started: Positively. He writes that the Hawks have positioned themselves for the next step with a revamped team, dazzling point guard and an updated arena.

Each and every night, he provides the team with the little things it needs in order to win: defense, screen-setting, rim-rolling, communication, and more. Rarely do his statistics pop off the paper due to his role, but Theis will occasionally stumble into a hot night where his simple, yet effective game turns in a big stat line. Below are his top five performances of the season to date. There were two Celtics stars during this game: Daniel Theis and Jayson Tatum. Tatum led the way with 33 points and 11 rebounds, but it was Theis who packed the most punch into the least amount of playing time among Boston\u2019s starters. Theis made six of his nine field goal attempts, including a 6-for-7 performance from inside the arc, to go along with seven rebounds, one assist and one steal during less than 26 minutes of action. Boston outscored Utah by 13 points while he was on the court, which trailed only Marcus Smart\u2019s plus-20 for the best mark in the game. His six made shots in the game are tied for his fourth-highest total of the season. Setting a new career high is a good way to plug a game onto this list. That\u2019s exactly what Theis did Nov. 20 in Los Angeles, when he tallied a career-best six assists. He committed only one turnover while setting up his teammates for open shots, completing the game with a sparkling assist-to-turnover ratio of 6-to-1. Additionally, Theis also hauled in a team-best 14 rebounds \u2013 at least five more than any other player on the Celtics. He also led the team and tied for the game high in steals with three, and pitched in eight points on 50 percent shooting from the field. Theis and the Celtics fell in overtime to the Clippers, 107-104, but that surely wasn\u2019t due to his play. He was great during this game. Dominant. That\u2019s what Theis was Jan. 22 against Memphis, when his play helped the Celtics outscore the Grizzlies by 31 points during only 19 minutes of playing time. We\u2019ll reiterate that: Boston outscored Memphis by 31 points during his 19 minutes of playing time! Theis shot 3-for-3 from long range and 4-for-7 from the field overall en route to 14 points, but the bulk of his work was done at the defensive end of the floor. He tallied three blocks to lead the Celtics outright, and two steals to tie for the top mark in the game. He also grabbed six rebounds during his 19 minutes of action. Again, Theis, with his plus-31 plus/minus rating, trailed only Smart (plus-35) in that category. Theis has logged a game score better than 17 only twice this season, per basketball-reference.com. One of those performances came March 10 in Indiana \u2013 the most recent game the Boston Celtics have played this season. That night, Theis canned eight of his 12 shot attempts to fall just one made field goal shy of his career high total of nine. He scored 20 points in the game, marking just the fourth instance in his career that he has broken the 20-point barrier. Theis was one of three Celtics who scored at least 20 points during the game, joining Tatum (30 points) and Gordon Hayward (27 points). He also led the Celtics with two blocked shots and contributed three assists during the game, which Boston won 114-111. It\u2019s always fun to watch a player set a new career high in scoring. Same goes for setting a new career high in rebounding. But watching him do both on the same night? That\u2019s just ridiculous, and that\u2019s exactly what Theis did Feb. 21 in Minnesota. Theis tallied career bests of 25 points and 16 rebounds against the Timberwolves while helping the C\u2019s to a 127-117 win. He was one of four starters who scored at least 25 points, marking the first time a team had four players reach that mark in a single game since 2006. Six of the 16 boards Theis grabbed were at the offensive end of the floor. He also blocked a shot, and he did all of this while playing less than 28 minutes. Have yourself a night, Daniel Theis! "}

Even though the hands-on nature of their jobs has been severely limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ainge and Co. are adapting to the unprecedented circumstances by staying on top of their roster-building responsibilities, while remaining hopeful that basketball will return in the near future. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just preparing for free agency, preparing for the draft, watching a lot of film and controlling the things that I can control,\u201d Ainge said Wednesday morning during a conference call with the media. The draft preparation process, in particular, has been altered significantly due to the global crisis. Normally at this time of year, the college season would have just wrapped up, the Draft Combine would be on the horizon, and teams would be just starting to invite players into their facilities for workouts and interviews. But this year, college basketball ended a month early without any tournament action, the Combine, which is scheduled yearly for mid-May, will likely be postponed or canceled, and the same can be said for all in-person workouts and interviews. Ainge, however, won\u2019t let such obstacles get in the way of his roster-building goals. \u201cYou still have to study and watch players,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cYou still have to do background checks and gather information on players. You still have to keep working and preparing as if the Draft is going to happen on June 25 until we hear otherwise. I don\u2019t think that any of us anticipate that will be the case, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d The importance of film study and background checks becomes magnified when a team is unable to meet a prospect in person, especially for someone like Ainge who considers first-hand interactions to be a critical part of the decision-making process. \u201cLet\u2019s just take Rajon Rondo as an example,\u201d he explained. \u201cHad I not been able to see him in the draft workout and sat down and talked with him and looked into his eyes, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve drafted him. And so, I think that there is value in that.\u201d Though, it\u2019s also possible to learn a great deal about a player through intensive research, just as Ainge has done with some of his other top draft choices from the past. \u201cWe drafted Avery Bradley without any draft workouts,\u201d Ainge recalled. \u201cWe drafted Steve Nash back in our Phoenix days without a draft workout. You don\u2019t always get guys in for draft workouts, so you have to be prepared to take guys. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing so much homework at this time and taking advantage of getting ahead of the game in case we don\u2019t get draft workouts and hope that we\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d As for his current squad, Ainge is making sure that they are prepared as well. He remains hopeful that the 2019-20 season will resume, which is why he\u2019s encouraging all of his players to stay physically and mentally ready. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching this like we\u2019re going to return to play and we\u2019re going to be playing playoff basketball,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cAnd we are staying in touch, we are having conference calls where we have guest speakers, motivational speakers that address all of our guys on Zoom. We are doing workouts with the coaches and with the strength coaches via zoom. So we\u2019re trying to do all we can and, for the most part, I\u2019ve been impressed with how much our players have bought in and the work that\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\u201d Meanwhile, Ainge and his staff will continue their hard work behind the scenes as well, as they adapt to the unprecedented circumstances while preparing their roster for future success.

Right off the bat, he gave the Celtics exactly what he had provided the Hornets throughout his previous eight seasons: leadership, positive energy, and All-Star-caliber play. The veteran point guard has proven that he could fill any role that the Celtics ask of him on any given night. He can facilitate, he can provide tenacious defense, and boy, can he score the basketball. Walker has produced countless exceptional performances throughout the 2019-20 campaign, though these five in particular stood above all others. October 26, 2019 was the night when Walker first showcased to Celtics fans the instant offense he can provide. After spending the first two games adjusting to his new environment, while shooting a combined 12-of-40 from the field, Walker walked into Madison Square Garden and had his Boston coming-out party. The veteran point guard torched the Knicks with 32 points on 11-of-17 shooting, including a 7-of-12 effort from beyond the arc, which placed him just two 3-point makes shy of the Celtics franchise record. He also corralled three boards on both ends of the court for a total of six in the game, dished out four assists and snagged two steals during 30 minutes of turnover-free action. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a lot from Kemba,\u201d backcourt mate Marcus Smart said after the 118-95 win. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need times when Kemba\u2019s going to have to take over games.\u201d Which is exactly what Walker did on this particular night in his hometown of New York City, where he set the tone for what was to come during his inaugural season with the C\u2019s. On the night after being selected to his fourth consecutive All-Star game, Walker proved exactly why he was worthy of earning such an honor. The Celtics arrived in Orlando without three of their top offensive threats in Jaylen Brown, Enes Kanter and Jayson Tatum, but their 6-foot point guard stepped up to the task and played a major role in filling the scoring void. He poured in 37 points on 12-of-23 shooting, knocked down 6-of-12 from deep and made all seven of his free throws, while also assisting on six of his teammates\u2019 baskets. NBA fans have come to expect such high-volume offensive efforts out of Walker, but what often flies under the radar is his defensive tenacity. He has snagged at least one steal in 60 percent of his games so far this season, and this defensive performance was his best of the bunch, as he logged a season-high four steals. The Celtics would outscore Orlando by 15 points during the second half, which allowed them to pull away for a 109-98 win in shorthanded fashion. And it was Walker who \u201cwilled us to be in that game,\u201d according to head coach Brad Stevens, just as Walker has done for many of Boston\u2019s wins throughout the season. Nov. 27 was a date that many Celtics fans had circled on their calendar right when the NBA schedule was released in mid-August. It was expected to be the first showdown between their former point guard, Kyrie Irving, and his successor, Kemba Walker. That showdown ultimately did not occur, however, as Irving would miss the contest due to a shoulder injury. Walker, on the other hand, not only showed up to play, but completely dominated the Brooklyn Nets. He dropped a then-season-high 39 points, while shooting 13-of-24 from the field, 6-of-10 from long range and a perfect 7-of-7 from the charity stripe. The veteran guard also corralled six rebounds and dished out four assists, all while receiving \u201cMVP\u201d chants throughout the night from Celtics fans inside TD Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s always a great feeling to have support from your fan base, and I most definitely appreciate this fan base,\u201d he said of earning such praiseful chants. And they were chants that were well deserved, as he put forth his best home effort of the entire season while leading the C\u2019s to a 121-110 win. In spite of his team\u2019s losing effort Dec. 11 in Indiana, Walker was without a doubt the star of the show. In what was his best offensive outing of the season, the point guard erupted for 44 points on 16-of-28 shooting, which included seven makes from long distance. He also assisted on seven other buckets, which made him responsible for a whopping 59 points \u2013 more than half of Boston\u2019s scoring production on the night. His Celtics, however, could not hold onto the five-point advantage they took into the fourth quarter, as they allowed Indy to slip by with a 122-117 win. Still, it was Walker who stood in the spotlight all night long, as he tallied 15 more points than any other player in the game. The Celtics faced their biggest challenge of the 2019-20 season Jan. 16, as they hit the road to take on the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks. Unsurprisingly, their All-Star point guard was up for the task, as he put forth his best all-around effort of the campaign. After being held scoreless during the first quarter of the contest, Walker exploded for 24 points during the second frame, which helped to pave the way for his second 40-point effort of the season. He finished with exactly that number in the scoring column, while contributing seven more points via three assists. Walker also pulled down a season-high 11 boards, which placed him just one shy of his career-best mark. Following his lead, the Celtics nearly overcame a 27-point deficit against the best team in the league, but they ultimately could not get over the hump as Milwaukee narrowly escaped with a 128-123 victory. Stevens couldn\u2019t deny, however, that Walker \u201cwas awfully special\u201d in this game, just as he has been throughout Boston's season thus far. "}

BOSTON \u2013 Jayson Tatum stepped up for the Boston Celtics on the court all season long. Now, during a time of global hardship, he\u2019s stepping up for his communities off the court. The 22-year-old All-Star announced Monday morning on Instagram that through a partnership between his Jayson Tatum Foundation, Feeding America, Lineage Logistics and his childhood friend, Bradley Beal, donations up to $250,000 would be matched to both the Boston and the St. Louis communities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Together, Tatum's and Beal's donations will help to provide food through Feeding America, the Greater Boston Food Bank and the St. Louis Food Bank, the latter of which represents their hometown. Shortly after making the announcement, Tatum joined a conference call with the Boston media, with whom he discussed the thought process behind the donation. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to find a way that I can be of some assistance during this time,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I always try to find a way to give back.\u201d Giving back is something that Tatum believes he and all of his NBA peers should be doing during this challenging time, considering their abundance of resources and vast global reach. Whether it be a donation of money or supplies, or even a simple message of encouragement, this is an opportunity for them to act as leaders and as role models. \u201cJust as professional athletes, using our platform, using our voice to speak out, we can reach so many people around the world through social media and things like that,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cAnd just sending out a positive message and encouraging everybody to do their part and being able to get through this together is, I think, the role that we have.\u201d For now, Tatum is putting his role as a community leader above his role as a basketball player. As a testament to that, during the conference call, he was asked about playing basketball at home during the quarantine period, but he responded that he didn\u2019t have access to a hoop. \u201cIt would be a lot easier, especially if I had a basketball court at my house, but that\u2019s kind of expensive,\u201d he responded. Yet, he\u2019s willing to fork over a hefty amount of cash to help out his fellow citizens who are in need of essential items. How\u2019s that for being a selfless leader? Tatum has also used his platform to help educate people about proper actions and inactions to take during the outbreak. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh even tweeted out a video last week of Tatum encouraging people to \u201ccontinue to practice social distancing and stay home as much as we can so that this can pass over and we can get through this together, so we can get back to doing things we love and being around our loved ones. So everybody, just continue do [your] part, stay safe, stay at home, continue to pray for our health and those in need.\u201d  .@jaytatum0 is one of our newest sports stars, upholding the #BostonStrong @celtics tradition of excellence and character. Thank you Jayson for your example to our youth and your words of encouragement. #rootingforboston pic.twitter.com/5Bz7UgtZst The way Tatum sees it, the sooner everyone buys into this protocol, the sooner everything can go back to normal. The sooner everything goes back to normal, the sooner he and his fellow NBA peers can return to the basketball court. In the meantime, Tatum will continue to do his part in helping the world return to normalcy while encouraging all who are capable to follow his lead. "}

During his fourth NBA season, Brown has emerged as a star. He has improved just about every area of his game \u2013 most notably his scoring, which has skyrocketed from 13.0 points per game last season to 20.4 PPG this season. Along the way, he has put forth some of the best individual performances of his young career, which we\u2019ve narrowed down to his Top 5. When Brown finds his offensive flow, he\u2019s capable of taking over a game in the blink of an eye. Such was the case Dec. 20 against Detroit, when he went on two separate scoring sprees to help the Celtics pull away with a blowout win. The first spree took place during the final 92 seconds of the first half, as Brown put forth the most impressive scoring burst of his young career. During that short stretch, he managed to rattle off 10 straight points, while knocking down three consecutive 3-pointers \u2013 the last of which resulted in a four-point play just 1.2 seconds before the halftime buzzer and sent the C\u2019s into the break with a 60-48 lead. He then had another incredible stretch during the third quarter, as he scored or assisted on another 10 consecutive points to help Boston build its lead even higher. Brown would wind up tying Jayson Tatum for the game high in points with 26, while also logging five rebounds, five assists, and a season-high-tying three steals to help lead the Celtics to a 114-93 victory. Perhaps Brown\u2019s greatest improvement this season has been his ability to create his own shot off the dribble. There was no greater display of this skill than on Feb. 1, when he and the Celtics hosted the Philadelphia 76ers. That night, Brown tied a career high with 13 made field goals and every single one was scored in off-the-dribble fashion. Of his 13 makes, 12 came from inside the arc, where he missed only once all game. He converted all seven of his attempts inside the restricted area, while connecting on 6-of-7 from mid-range. Brown also knocked down one 3-pointer and made 5-of-7 from the free-throw line, which gave him a game-high 32 points. He tied for the game high in rebounds with nine and tied for the team high in steals with two. And, he posted a season-best plus-29 plus/minus rating while leading the Celtics to a 116-95 blowout win over their Atlantic Division rival. The Celtics, as a team, have not experienced much recent success in San Antonio, but the same cannot be said about Jaylen Brown. Returning Nov. 9 from a three-game absence due to an illness, Brown logged his second consecutive 30-point game inside AT&amp;T Center, while leading Boston to its first victory in the Alamo City in nine seasons. After falling behind 7-0, Brown sparked the C\u2019s with a personal seven-point run of his own to tie the game up. Following his lead, Boston rolled to a 135-115 win, marking its largest margin of victory on the Spurs\u2019 home court since a 137-108 victory on March 4, 1980. Brown finished with a game-high 30 points, while shooting 10-of-18 from the field and a career-best 9-of-10 from the free-throw line. He also led the Celtics in the rebounding department with seven boards, dished out three assists, and did not commit a single turnover during his 32 minutes of action. The other city in which the Celtics had struggled in recent times was Toronto. That was until Christmas Day, when Brown gift-wrapped a 30-point, six-rebound, four-assist performance to help Boston end its eight-game drought north of the border. In what was tied for the most efficient high-volume shooting effort of his career, the 23-year-old wing knocked down 10-of-13 from the field, 5-of-7 from deep and 5-of-6 from the free-throw line while becoming the youngest player in franchise history to reach the 30-point mark on Christmas. What made Brown\u2019s high efficiency even more impressive was the fact that many of his makes came in the form of contested jumpers late in the shot clock.  \u201cHe played with extreme confidence,\u201d said Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry, a five-time All-Star. \u201cHe played with some bounce, and his overall game was just flowing.\u201d It was flowing enough to help the Celtics end their four-season drought in Toronto, as Brown steered the Celtics to a 118-102 victory. As great as Brown\u2019s Christmas Day masterpiece was, it wasn\u2019t even his best performances of that week. Two days later, back in Boston, the fourth-year wing put forth the most impressive effort of his NBA career, as he posted a career-high 34 points to lead the Celtics to a 129-117 beatdown of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Brown was knocking down shots all over the floor that afternoon, as he canned 8-of-10 from inside the 3-point arc, 5-of-10 from outside the arc, and 3-of-4 from the free-throw line. He also corralled a game-high nine rebounds and dished out a pair of assists. Oh, and he accomplished all of that while spending only 29 minutes on the court. Not only was Brown the top performer in this game, but he\u2019s also the one who sealed the win. Cleveland was able to cut a 22-point deficit down to nine early in the fourth quarter, but Brown slammed the door on the its rally. He canned two 3-pointers during a 25-second span, and then threw down a dunk which pushed Boston\u2019s lead back up to 18 points with 6:41 remaining. From there, the Celtics coasted to their second straight dominant victory, which gave Brown even more reason to celebrate the best two-game stretch of his career. "}

The upward trajectory continued into his sixth season, as the longest-tenured Celtic has shown improvement in both his shooting and playmaking abilities, while also somehow getting even better on the defensive end.       Along the way, Smart has delivered an abundance of strong performances, which we have narrowed down to a Top 5. Here are his top individual efforts so far during the 2019-20 campaign. Offensively-driven efforts are typically the first that come to mind when thinking about top performances. But since we\u2019re talking about Marcus Smart, it\u2019s only right to throw one of his greatest defensive gems into the mix. One of the first such outings that comes to mind from this season is the role he played in limiting Kristaps Porzingis during Boston\u2019s Nov. 11 matchup against Dallas. Despite standing 11 inches shorter than Porzingis, Smart was able to play a large part in holding the 7-foot-3 former All-Star to four points on a dreadful 1-of-11 shooting effort, marking his worst performances since an 0-for-11 game against Smart and the Celtics on Dec. 21, 2017. The towering forward attempted to post up Smart three times over the course of the game, but failed to score on each occasion. Meanwhile, Smart made a great impact on the other end of the floor as well, as he tallied 17 points and six assists to help Boston to a 116-106 win. But the most memorable part of the matchup was the way in which Smart handled his much-larger opponent, along with the message he delivered to all big men who believe that they can take advantage of a height mismatch against him: \u201cKeep it coming. Plain and simple. Keep it coming.\u201d As spectacular as Smart\u2019s defense has continued to be throughout the campaign, his offensive leap has been just as impressive. Smart tallied the four highest-scoring games of his career from Jan. 18-onward, including a 26-point effort Feb. 29 at home against the Houston Rockets. Smart made nine field goals, including five from long range, while also logging seven assists, five rebounds and a game-high four steals during a whopping 45 minutes of action. He also made one of the biggest plays of the game just before the end of regulation when he tipped Jayson Tatum\u2019s intentionally-missed free throw out to Jaylen Brown, who then sent the game into overtime with a miraculous 3-point buzzer-beater. Boston went on to lose the game 111-110, while Smart was its only starter to finish with a positive plus/minus rating (plus-2). The 26-point effort against Houston happened to be Smart\u2019s second straight offensive masterpiece inside TD Garden. On Feb. 13, just before the All-Star break, the guard put forth a 31-point performance, which helped to lead the Celtics to a 141-133 double-overtime win over the LA Clippers. During his 46 minutes of playing time, Smart knocked down 10-of-20 from the field, including five shots from beyond the arc, while also logging four rebounds, three assists and matching LA\u2019s team total in steals with a game high of four. \u201cAny competitor loves coming through for your teammates,\u201d he said after the most thrilling win of the season. \u201cIt keeps you going. I love it and I hope it keeps up.\u201d Clearly, it did. Smart\u2019s Nov. 25 outing against the Kings may not have been one of his most remarkable statistical performances of the season, but it was without a doubt his most clutch. Smart managed to deliver not one, not two, but three winning plays over the final 50 seconds of action, which ultimately helped Boston seal a 103-102 win. First, he broke a 99-99 tie on a high-arcing, fadeaway jumper with 49.9 seconds remaining. It only took 10 seconds for Bogdan Bogdanovic to respond with a go-ahead 3-pointer, but Smart punched right back nine seconds later by tossing in a runner off the glass, which would turn out to be the game-winning bucket. But before the final buzzer sounded, he had to put his defensive imprint on the game, which he did just 3.2 seconds later by ripping the ball out of Bogdanovic\u2019s hands to all but secure the one-point win. Smart would finish with 17 points, three rebounds, seven assists, a season-high five steals, and three winning plays during the final minute. Smart has faced a significant amount of criticism for his 3-point shooting over the years, but that was all put to rest Jan. 18. That was the night he penned his name into the Celtics record book by knocking down a franchise record 11 3-pointers, en route to a career-high 37 points. Smart came out firing right away against the Suns, as he pulled up and canned his first triple of the game just nine seconds after tip-off. He would knock down five more treys before halftime, and another five after the break to push him past Ray Allen, Isaiah Thomas and Antoine Walker, who previously shared the team's single-game record with nine 3-point makes. In all, he attempted 22 shots from beyond the arc \u2013 also a franchise mark \u2013 and shot 13-of-25 from the field in total. He also tallied team highs in assists (eight) and steals (four), while corralling five rebounds. Despite Smart\u2019s career effort, the Celtics ended up falling to the Suns, 123-119. But years from now, the score and result are not what will be remembered from this game. Smart\u2019s record-breaking 3-point effort will be the only lasting memory from that night inside TD Garden.

Hayward, who spoke to media members on a conference call Friday morning after donating 450 Dunkin Donuts gift cards to Emergency Room workers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, fully understands that the league is operating in uncharted territory amid the Coronavirus pandemic that has swept the world off its feet. The fallout from the pandemic has led to an NBA hiatus three-quarters of the way through the regular season and has created speculation as to what the league will look like if and when it is able to return. \u201cI think that whatever scenario they come up with is going to be something that none of us players have dealt with before,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cWhether that\u2019s everyone being in Vegas or another location, whether that\u2019s playing with no fans.\u201d Hayward then took a moment to hypothesize about what it would be like to play games \u2013 and maybe even the Playoffs \u2013 without fans inside the arenas. \u201cI think playing with no fans would be pretty wild,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would almost be like a scrimmage at training camp. You\u2019d have to bring all of your own energy. Home-court advantage is pretty much thrown out the window at that point in time.\u201d Another option that Hayward threw out as a possibility was a condensed Playoffs that would include fewer games, such as best-of-five series instead of best-of-seven series. The divisional round of the playoffs was a best-of-five series until the league switched to a best-of-seven format back in 2003. Regardless of which path the league decides to take, Hayward explained that returning to game action will not be a smooth transition for players. He predicted that players, many of whom haven\u2019t been able to shoot a basketball, let alone get up and down a court during this national emergency, will need two to three weeks of training to be able to return to the court without risking their physical health. Then there is the mental hurdle of returning to game action \u2013 potentially with a rapid progression into a playoff run \u2013 after a hiatus that is likely to last for multiple months. \u201cI think the mental and emotional side of it is certainly going to be something that we\u2019re all going to have to work through when we get back,\u201d Hayward commented. \u201cBecause you just get in this mode and in this mindset when you\u2019re in the middle of the season. And then to just kind of not have that for however long a period this is going to be. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an adjustment to get back into that, especially if we get back and it\u2019s almost right into the Playoffs. You\u2019ve got to be able to really turn it on there and get really locked in and focused again.\u201d Hayward then revealed that this is a topic the Celtics have already broached and prepared for as a group. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that the staff and the coaches for us have talked to us about a little bit,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve done some Zoom calls with the team and trying to stay connected, and I think that will help us out when we get back.\u201d In the meantime, Hayward is doing what he can to stay in shape at home while enjoying extra time with his family. He revealed that he has been using a Peloton bike to keep his cardio conditioning at a high level. When the weather has been nice \u2013 which has been a rarity in Boston of late \u2013 he has also gone outside for runs. From a strength standpoint, he has been utilizing dumbbell and kettlebell weights at home that the team delivered to him. From a family perspective, Hayward has spent the full days with his wife, three daughters and dog by going on walks, playing outside, and even teaching them how to ride a bike. \u201cTrying to get the girls to learn to ride their bikes without training wheels,\u201d Hayward said with a chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s not going too great right now. But I\u2019m gonna keep trying at that.\u201d This is an unprecedented time in which many US citizens have an opportunity to seize the finer things in life, such as family time. There is no doubt, however, that the NBA, its players and its teams are anxious to return to action \u2013 regardless of how foreign the league may feel when that time finally arrives. "}

However, Enes Kanter, who is one such player, is still making the most out of his newfound free time. The Celtics center is discovering new ways to stay physically and mentally active every day, whether it be in the form of maintaining his fitness, providing entertainment for himself and others, or expanding upon his own personal growth by exploring new passions. \u201cI feel like this is the best time to invest in yourself, to educate yourself,\u201d Kanter said Friday afternoon during a conference call with the media. In his case, Kanter has been approaching self-investment just like he approaches his game on the court: by going all-out. The veteran big man has been filling his days by reading books, watching documentaries, working out, and providing entertainment on social media as a way to \u201ckeep the fans\u2019 spirits up\u201d during the NBA hiatus. He\u2019s even picked up a couple of new hobbies, as he has been teaching himself how to cook some of his favorite Turkish dishes, and also how to play the piano. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to spend my time on some things that I\u2019ve never done before,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cLike my mom always used to tell me, \u2018Learn how to cook. You\u2019re going to need it.\u2019 And now, I have been actually ordering Uber Eats almost every day and I\u2019m really trying to focus on how to cook. \u201cAnd I love piano, so I\u2019m really trying to learn how to play piano. So, I\u2019ve been very busy.\u201d  Welcome to Chef Kanter\u2019s kitchen today we are making Menemen B\u00f6rek \u00c7ay A post shared by  Enes Kanter (@eneskanter11) on Mar 30, 2020 at 4:53pm PDT Kanter has also been busy trying to stay in shape.  As soon as the NBA announced its indefinite postponement in mid-March, the Celtics training staff put together a virtual fitness plan, which Kanter and his teammates have been following at home. \u201cObviously we are at home and it\u2019s a little more chill, but the Celtics being on us to stay in shape has been amazing,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cWe have these little (virtual) groups of four or five players, and then the strength coaches are coming in on video conference and making sure that we\u2019re doing it.\u201d Outside of the virtual workouts, the Celtics have been able to stay connected with each other through Zoom teleconferences. These meetings are both entertaining and comforting for Kanter, as it gives him a way to stay involved with his teammates, whom he misses dearly. \u201cWith the Celtics, it\u2019s like your family. And not seeing your family is tough,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cSo when we do these conferences, it\u2019s so amazing to just see their faces, see what they\u2019re doing, have conversations with them, and just be with them. Because we\u2019re all hoping that the season is going to resume one day, and we all want to keep that chemistry together even when cannot be with each other. So those (calls) have been very productive.\u201d Staying productive is what is helping Kanter to get through this difficult and unusual time. He misses playing basketball and being with his teammates every day. He misses the fans and the one-of-a-kind experience of playing inside TD Garden. He yearns for the day when all of that returns; when he and the rest of the world can go back to living their normal lives. But for now, he\u2019ll make the most out of this situation by staying physically and mentally productive, by investing in his own personal growth, and by trying to keep everyone else\u2019s spirits up until the world moves past this pandemic.

{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/sidebar/misc-032720-celtics-adapting-lifestyle-changes-amidst-nba-hiatus", "date": "2020-03-27 00:00:00", "tags": ["Smart, Marcus", "Stevens, Brad", "Celtics", "Sidebar", "Regular Season"], "article": " BOSTON \u2013 It\u2019s been 17 days since the Boston Celtics played their last basketball game, and it\u2019s uncertain when they\u2019ll play their next. What is certain is that their daily routine, along with that of billions of people around the world, must be put on hold as they try to safely establish a new sense of normalcy amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, the day after the NBA announced the indefinite postponement of the 2019-20 season, the Celtics returned home from Milwaukee and immediately isolated themselves from the outside world. Since that day, there have been no team practices, no direct socialization with one another, no working out with personal trainers, and no face-to-face interaction with fans. Such sacrifices were required in order to help suppress such an unprecedented worldwide outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unique, unsettling time for everyone,\u201d C\u2019s coach Brad Stevens said Friday morning during a conference call with the media. It was especially unsettling for the Celtics last week when they learned that Marcus Smart had tested positive for the virus. Smart, who is the only member of the team who has contracted the virus, has been fortunate in that he remains asymptomatic. Despite not feeling ill, he\u2019s been adamant in remaining quarantined until the virus is completely out of his system. On top of that, he\u2019s been using his platform to advocate for others to follow his lead. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking in with him, as everybody else has, very regularly,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him on conference calls a few times and he seems to be doing really well, and I\u2019m proud of how he kind of took the initiative to tell people that he had it and that he felt good, and how he got online and just continues to ask people to practice social distancing and self-isolation right now.\u201d Despite being isolated, the Celtics are still finding ways to stay in shape and stay connected to one another. They\u2019ve all had stationary bikes and individual weights delivered to their respective homes, and they\u2019ve been participating in voluntary virtual training sessions. \u201cAs a coaching staff, we\u2019re keeping a pulse on all of our team and all of our individuals,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019re on Zoom teleconferences a couple times a week so we can all see each other\u2019s faces and talk about non-basketball things. But we\u2019re like the rest of the world in that basketball is taking a far backseat. \u201cI think it\u2019s more important right now that we\u2019re a community of coworkers and a community of friends and people that care about each other that get online and make sure we\u2019re all doing OK. So everybody\u2019s checking in every day individually, and then two to three times a week, we\u2019ve already had two Zoom conferences this week and we\u2019ll have a couple more next week.\u201d Stevens and his coaching staff are finding ways to stay active in their line of work as well. Typically, after a season concludes, Stevens will conduct various evaluations through film studies, statistical studies and individual progress reports. The current hiatus, however, has allowed him to get a head start on such evaluations, which should come in handy if and when the 2019-20 season eventually resumes. If the season does, in fact, recommence, the Celtics, along with all other NBA teams would find themselves in uncharted waters \u2013 having to re-acclimate and recondition themselves mid-campaign. \u201cI\u2019m sure everybody is looking at different things and tweaks and things that were really good for them when they reviewed and analyzed their team, and things that weren\u2019t as good,\u201d Stevens said of the unique process. \u201cAnd other than that, I\u2019m just working on things that I think will be applicable when we get back together. But, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate right now to be hammering basketball with our guys.\u201d Right now, the most important thing for the Celtics is to remain healthy, safe and stable, both from a physical and mental standpoint. For the foreseeable future, basketball must take a backseat as they join the rest of the world in committing themselves toward bending the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. "}

Indiana scored its sixth win in its last seven games and eighth in the last 10 on Sunday, winning 112-109 at Dallas. The victory closed out a 4-1 road swing for the Pacers, who now embark on a stretch where three of their next four game are against teams that enter Monday: in third place in the Eastern Conference (Boston), in sixth place and one game behind Indiana (Philadelphia), and in fourth place team and two games ahead of the Pacers in fourth (Miami). \"Great win, great road trip. Now we've got to go home and take care of home (court advantage),\" Victor Oladipo said in his postgame interview with Fox Sports Indiana on Sunday. \"It shows our potential, especially when we have everybody healthy ... There's still a lot of season left, still a lot of room to grow, still a lot of things we need to get better at, but we're on the up.\" Indiana has not fielded an entirely full-strength roster often this season. The two-time All-Star Oladipo returned from a yearlong absence due to a quadriceps injury on Jan. 29, less than a month before Jeremy Lamb sustained a season-ending ACL tear. The Pacers concluded their road trip without Malcolm Brogdon, who left the March 4 loss at Milwaukee with a hip injury. His status is day-to-day. Doug McDermott was also scratched on Sunday with a toe injury. Despite the absences, balanced production has buoyed Indiana. Six Pacers scored in double figures at Dallas, led by All-Star Domantas Sabonis' double-double of 20 points and 17 rebounds. Not including Lamb, who was averaging 12.5 points per game at the time of his injury on Feb. 24, Indiana's lineup features seven players averaging between 9.5 and 18.6 points per game. The Pacers owe much of their scoring balance to effective ball distribution, with 61.7 percent of the team's made field goals coming via assist. That is one of the top 10 rates in the league. Boston has flourished with a similarly effective scoring balance, but a rash of injuries since the All-Star break hindered the Celtics in four losses over their last five games. Boston coughed up an 18-point, fourth-quarter lead in a March 3 overtime loss to Brooklyn with All-Star Jayson Tatum sidelined due to injury. Tatum returned for the March 4 win at Cleveland, but the Celtics were without Gordon Hayward, who sustained a knee contusion against Brooklyn, and Jaylen Brown, who tweaked his hamstring in the overtime loss to the Nets. Celtics coach Brad Stevens has also been limiting the workload of All-Star Kemba Walker, whose bothersome knee continues to give him issues. Walker, Tatum and Hayward all played in Sunday's 105-104 loss to Oklahoma City, though Brown remained sidelined. Brown told MassLive.com he is targeting Wednesday for a return to practice, ahead of the Celtics' matchup with NBA-leading Milwaukee on Thursday. Tuesday's matchup with Indiana is the first of two important road dates for Boston, which fell three games behind Toronto for the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, and now only leads Miami by 1 1/2 games. \"We've got to try our best to hold our heads high,\" Walker told reporters following the OKC loss. \"Stuff like this happens.\" "}

We want to clarify information regarding what the team has done and is doing. Last night, it was learned that a player on the Utah Jazz preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19, and a second case has been reported this morning. The Celtics played the Jazz on Friday, March 6. We have been in constant communication with\u00a0our\u00a0Massachusetts Department of Public Health officials, including Larry Madoff MD of the Bureau of Infectious Disease\u00a0and Laboratory Sciences at the Department. Specific to the news about the Utah players, the DPH\u00a0has advised us that based on those players\u2019 health statuses during this period, it is unlikely that anyone from the team came into contact with them while they were contagious. However, notwithstanding this information, we are exercising an abundance of caution in taking every measure to be vigilant and safe. These steps will include having players and staff who were in close contact with the Utah players or who traveled to Milwaukee to self-quarantine through the weekend, during which time all players will be tested, as will staff who came into close contact with the Utah players or who exhibit symptoms. We will also take any additional measures as necessary and as recommended by the DPH. The safety of our fans, players, staff, and media is of paramount importance to us, and we will continue to monitor developments and provide information as we work with league and health officials through this situation.

But it's a rut that they know they can dig their way out of. Following Sunday's loss, coach Brad Stevens reminded us that every good team goes through such moments of struggle during the long, grinding regular season, and there's no reason why this team won't be able to rediscover the rhythm they had been in throughout the majority of the campaign. \u201cThis is part of navigating your way through this stuff,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cSo you can feel like you\u2019re on top of the world one week and you can feel like the sky is falling the next. That\u2019s the hardest part of the NBA is that\u2019s just the way it goes. We\u2019re playing in a way right now where we just don\u2019t sustain the way that we have and the way that we know we can.\u201d During Sunday night\u2019s loss, for example, the Celtics were unable to sustain the 18-point lead they had built up during the second quarter against the Thunder. Boston dominated the first 11 minutes of the frame, during which time it outscored OKC 37-17. Things fell apart during the final minute before halftime, however, as the Thunder struck with a quick, 7-0 run to cut the deficit down to 11. \u201cWe loosened up defensively, kind of let our guard down a little bit, and they put a run on us,\u201d Gordon Hayward said of the last-minute breakdown. \u201cThat was huge.\u201d The Thunder then carried their momentum into the third quarter, as they outscored the C\u2019s 31-21 while cutting their deficit down to one point. The game went down to the wire from there, with both teams battling back and forth throughout the final frame, before OKC was able to sneak by with a one-point win. The loss marked Boston\u2019s sixth in its last 11 games, after having won 10 of its previous 11. It\u2019s the second time this season that the team has gone through a rough patch, as it dropped six of eight during it's most trying stretch of the season in January. \u201cI\u2019ve lived this before with most of our good teams go through stretches like this and usually two or three a year,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThis is our second one. Hopefully we can nip that in the bud and not have a third one.\u201d In order to nip this difficult stretch in the bud, the C\u2019s must maintain a resilient attitude. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to stay together,\u201d said Kemba Walker. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been some very tough losses. But we\u2019ve got to try our best to hold our heads high. Stuff like this happens. Losses come and you can learn from them. You can choose to get better, or go the other way and everybody just go to their own individual corners. But what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to get better and we\u2019re going to continue to stay together.\u201d The road won\u2019t get easier in the immediate future, as the Celtics will pack their bags and head on a two-game road trip to face a couple of playoff-bound teams in Indiana and Milwaukee. But the C\u2019s will embrace the challenge, as they try to regain their spark. \u201cThese are tough games coming up, but that\u2019s good because you\u2019ve got to do tough things to get yourself out of a rut,\u201d Stevens said. And if they can dig their way out of this rut, they\u2019ll look back on this tough stretch and smile. \u201cThis is the part about the NBA that is hard,\u201d Stevens concluded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also fun to look back on when you overcome it.\u201d "}

But none of that mattered, because Daniel Theis was about to save the day for the C\u2019s with a couple of clutch offensive possessions. First, Theis delivered with the biggest splash of the game. The play started with Kemba Walker sending an alley-oop pass in the direction of Gordon Hayward, but after making an off-balance catch in mid-air, Hayward opted to fire the ball back beyond the arc to Theis. With Aaron Holiday closing him out, Theis faked a pass toward Walker on his right. Holiday bit on the fake, leaving Theis wide open from straightaway center, where he rose up and knocked down the game-tying 3-pointer. Victor Oladipo would put Indy back up on its next possession with a pair of free throws, but Theis wasn\u2019t done yet. During Boston\u2019s next ensuing trip up the court, Jayson Tatum received a pass on the left wing and Theis came over to help out by setting a pick on T.J. Warren. The screen allowed Tatum to dribble past his man, but it then left him with Myles Turner to deal with. Fortunately, Theis was quick enough to backpedal and spin around to seal off Indiana's elite rim protector, which created a wide-open lane to the basket. Tatum took full advantage of it by driving full steam ahead for a game-tying slam dunk. Turner missed a 3-point attempt during the Pacers\u2019 next possession, and then Marcus Smart capitalized by delivering a beautiful go-ahead layup with 50 seconds remaining. Walker and Smart then sealed the game at the free-throw line, which allowed the Celtics to walk away with a 114-111 victory. Gordon Hayward had himself quite the homecoming Tuesday night in Indianapolis, where he delivered one of his best performances of the season in front of family and friends. The Indy native poured in 27 points on 10-of-19 shooting from the field, while also corralling a game-leading 10 rebounds, dishing out a team-leading five assists, snagging two steals, and blocking one shot. Nearly all of Hayward's offensive production came during the first and third quarters, as he opened the game up with a 13-point frame, and then came out of the half with a 12-point period. That scoring, coupled with the double-digit rebounding effort gave Hayward his first 25-10 since Dec. 21, 2016 when he was a member of the Utah Jazz. Marcus Smart on the tough win. "}

Little did I know just how passionate, strong, and welcoming the front office would be. It didn\u2019t take long for me to see the unique and clear lineage of women in the office helping and encouraging one another, especially those in the earlier stages of their careers. I was fortunate enough to have met a couple of these women prior to my internship at local networking events\u2014 specifically my manager, Chrissy Leach, as well as McKenzie Pezze and Amanda Pflugrad, who have since become my closest mentors and role models. Being that March is Women\u2019s History Month, it is the perfect time to reflect on my experience with the women of the front office thus far and thank those who have made the largest impact on my confidence in the workplace. Carley and Eileen \u2013 Thank you both for including me in the planning process of International Women\u2019s Day and providing me the unique opportunity to highlight my experience and express my gratitude for the platform the Celtics have given me. Few interns are presented the chance to write an article, nonetheless get published on their organization\u2019s website. I am deeply appreciative of your efforts to include me on a night that I am so passionate about as well as your encouragement to use my voice. Your efforts have proven how special and supportive the Celtics community is and I feel lucky to be a part of this empowering organization. Chrissy \u2013 Thank you for going above and beyond as my manager to ensure I am maximizing my exposure within the organization and encouraging me to dip my toes into all aspects of the business. I am so grateful for your eagerness to include me on projects and introduce me to other colleagues so that I can learn as much as possible throughout my internship. Mackenzie H. \u2013 Thank you for being so welcoming and supportive of me. From our few interactions, you have proven to me that the female support in the Celtics community truly stems from the top down. You might not know the impact our passing conversations and meetings have made on me, but from previous experience I know how rare it is for a Vice President with your tenure to be as genuinely concerned with an intern\u2019s wellbeing, comfortability, and experience as you are. Amanda \u2013 Thank you for always checking in on me, even when it's 3:00 a.m. and you\u2019re jet lagged, fresh off another long road trip with the team. Your kind and genuine nature inspires me to be the best version of myself and I truly look up to you, both in and out of the workplace. I hope to gain half the confidence you have one day. I am so appreciative of your supportive pep- talks and messages, despite not having any obligation to do so. McKenzie P. \u2013 Thank you for everything you have done for me-- from responding to the myriad of questions I ask you to taking breaks to grab coffee and catch up when you sense I\u2019m a little off. No one has supported me more in my professional development than you. You have not only become my mentor over the past few months but my role model and friend. I hope to emulate the same dedication and passion you put into your work and into supporting other girls in the sports industry. I am proud to call you my mentor and I hope you feel that same sense of pride in calling me your mentee. To the countless others \u2013 Thank you for supporting me, encouraging me, and empowering me. I look forward to being in your shoes one day and making as large of an impact on younger women\u2019s careers as you have done for me. "}

But since that 112-111 road win Feb. 9 that extended Boston's winning streak to seven, things have been a struggle for the Celtics. The Celtics are 5-5 since, including dropping three of their last four heading into Sunday's home game against the Thunder. Marcus Smart was disappointed yet resolute after Boston's loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday. \"We're going to figure it out,\" the Celtics' sixth-year guard said. The time to do that, though, is narrowing with just 20 games left to play. Smart tried to be positive about the Celtics' recent struggles, though he also had some pointed criticism, saying he disagreed with coach Brad Stevens' assessment that effort wasn't the issue, using an expletive to describe the effort. \"We gave them the first couple punches and then, after that, our effort died down,\" Smart said. \"We picked it up toward the end, but it was too late at that time.\" Boston's only win in the last four came over the woebegone Cleveland Cavaliers. Stevens said he thought one of the major issues came down to being healthy. Kemba Walker has been on a minutes restriction since returning from missing five games due to left knee soreness. Both Jaylen Brown (hamstring) and Gordon Hayward (right knee) have missed the last two games and are expected to be out again Sunday, though Stevens left the door open to Hayward's return. \"That's the way the league works,\" Stevens said. \"You play as well as you can.\" Walker said he was hopeful the minutes restriction would soon be lifted. \"I'm just coming in and out the game pretty fast,\" Walker said. \"Just gotta keep working through it and trying my hardest not to frustrate myself.\" After Sunday's game, the Celtics will play seven of their next nine games away from home. The game is the last in a three-game road trip for the Thunder, who have won at the Detroit Pistons and New York Knicks in their two previous outings. Oklahoma City has won 11 of its last 12 on the road, with its only loss during the streak -- which started in the first week of January - coming against the Bucks in Milwaukee. After dropping their first six games away from home to start the season, the Thunder are 19-5 on the road. \"We've got to keep it moving,\" Thunder point guard Chris Paul said. While the Celtics have been banged up lately, Oklahoma City has enjoyed a period of relative health. Rookie forward Darius Bazley hasn't played since the last meeting with the Celtics, missing 10 consecutive games with a bone bruise in his right knee. He's not far from a possible return, though he won't play Sunday. Everyone else that's played this season has been healthy recently. \"We've got basically 20 auditions before the playoffs,\" Paul said. \"We've got to start building the right habits and making sure we're ready for the stretch run.\" "}

The All-Star point guard dominated down the stretch of that game, as he scored eight points during the final two minutes and forty seconds, including the game-sealing free-throw with 3.4 seconds remaining to secure a 112-111 Celtics win. \u201cHe\u2019s a handful, and he\u2019s hard to guard,\u201d Donovan said ahead of Sunday's tip-off. \u201cI actually thought that we defended him well on several possessions coming down the stretch, but he made some tough shots. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d What made the effort even more remarkable was that Walker accomplished it against a backcourt featuring nine-time All-Defensive teamer Chris Paul and another high-energy guard in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Still, Walker managed to drive and draw contact at will, as he made it to the free-throw line 13 times during the contest. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously got great feet, he\u2019s got great speed and he\u2019s terrific with the ball,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cSo for us, I\u2019ve always said, against elite scorers you\u2019ve got to make it as hard as you can against them. We did a good job for a good portion of the game, but obviously he got loose late. But he also made some tough shots over some outstretched arms, which to his credit, he made some timely plays.\u201d Though Walker hasn\u2019t had a performance of such magnitude since that game. A right knee injury has hampered his production and playing time since Feb. 9, as he\u2019s played in just four games while averaging 16.8 points on 31.3 percent shooting. Following Friday night\u2019s effort against Utah, however, Walker claimed to be making strides, as he made it through the whole game without feeling any pain. \u201cDefinitely trending upward and I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d he said after a 13-point, seven-assist effort. \u201cToday was the best I felt in a little while, so I\u2019m happy about that.\u201d Walker is still on a playing-time restriction that will limit him to fewer than 30 minutes of action tonight, but he hopes to continue to rediscover his rhythm against a team that he\u2019s had great success against recently. - Taylor Snow "}

The entire crowd was on its feet. Both teams made critical plays. The Celtics just needed one more to be able to come out on top. Boston had a chance to win on the final possession of the game after it inexplicably turned the ball over on an inbound play and allowed Dennis Schroder to score what in the end served as the game-winning layup. The Celtics went to Jayson Tatum for the final shot, and he had a great matchup advantage against 6-foot Chris Paul. Tatum went to the mid-post on Paul, and after two dribbles released a fadeaway from just outside the right elbow. His shot fell short off the front of the rim, and the Celtics were unable to get a shot off after grabbing an offensive rebound. Boston needed a game-winning shot after it gave the ball up at the other end of the court just moments earlier. With 13.8 seconds left in the game and with the Celtics leading by one, Kemba Walker accepted an inbound pass from Marcus Smart in the backcourt and along the sideline. He caught the pass and immediately began to dribble backward toward the corner of the court in an attempt to turn the corner and force the Thunder to foul him. However, Paul played great defense and eventually combined with Schroder to trap Walker and force a turnover. Schroder stripped the ball away from Walker as Boston\u2019s point guard tried to get the ball out of the trap, and Schroder put home an easy layup to win the game. Gordon Hayward returned Sunday night from a one-game absence and gave the Celtics what he\u2019s given them all season long: great shooting and strong play across the board. Hayward finished with a team-best 24 points against the Thunder while shooting it at a high clip from all over the court. He connected on nine of his 19 field goals, good for 47.4 percent, and four of his seven 3-point attempts (57.1 percent). He made four beautiful midrange shots to go along with his four 3-pointers. None of his buckets were scored from inside the paint. In addition to his scoring, Hayward also provided the Celtics with five rebounds, four assists, two blocked shots and a steal during his 37-plus minutes of action. This night ended on a somber note for the C\u2019s, but at least they\u2019re one step closer to healthy now that they have Hayward back in the lineup and playing at a high level.

That dry spell cost the Celtics the game. The C\u2019s scored just two points during the final 4:53 of the quarter \u2013 both from the free-throw line \u2013 while Utah scored eight. That scoring differential might not sound like a lot, but it allowed the Jazz to build a 79-66 lead while sucking the air out of Boston\u2019s team. Over the final 4:53 of the period, the Celtics shot 0-for-5 from the field while committing five turnovers. Those five turnovers accounted for 41.7 percent of the team\u2019s turnovers in the entire game. The offensive disconnect that Boston showcased during this stretch of play was entirely uncharacteristic. The Celtics are typically very connected, and, as was indicated above, they committed a total of just seven turnovers during the other 43-plus minutes of the contest. Utah never allowed the C\u2019s to regain an offensive rhythm from that point forward. Boston finished the game shooting just 37.2 percent from the field and 27.8 percent from 3-point range while suffering a 99-94 defeat. In a rare occurrence, no player on the Boston Celtics logged a strong box score Friday night. As a result, Mike Conley of the visiting Jazz slides into this section. Conley put together one of his top performances of the season Friday by dropping 25 points on the Celtics. This effort marked just the third time this season that Conley had surpassed the 22-point mark. Conley shot 9-for-16 shooting from the field and a sizzling 6-for-10 from beyond the 3-point arc. He also dished out five assists, grabbed three rebounds and grabbed three steals. Conley played more than 34 minutes of the game and finished as the only Jazz starter who logged a plus/minus rating better than minus-17. He blew his fellow starters away by logging a plus-six in that category. Marcus Smart on the Celtics "}
{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/post-ups-20200306", "article": " BOSTON \u2013 An area in which the Boston Celtics are looking to improve as they head down the final stretch of the regular season is their ability to defend drives from the perimeter. It\u2019s a challenge with which they\u2019ve grappled throughout the campaign, and particularly over the past week. Entering Friday, Boston had allowed an opposing perimeter player to score at least 37 points in four consecutive games. It all started last Feb. 26 in Utah, where Jazz wing Donovan poured in 37 points during a Celtics win. That was followed by Rockets guard Russell Westbrook\u2019s 41-point effort on Sunday, which was then followed by a career-high 51-point showing from Nets wing Caris LeVert on Tuesday, and most recently, there was Cavaliers guard Collin Sexton's career-high 41-point game on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had that issue at times all through the year, not just the last couple of games,\u201d Stevens pointed out Friday evening before hosting the Utah Jazz at TD Garden. \u201cWe\u2019ve had moments when we\u2019ve been OK at that, but we\u2019ve gotta be better. The other day we were late to rotate, to challenge, in both of those games (against LeVert and Sexton) a couple of times, but we also got beat too directly off the dribble.\u201d The issue in itself is simple to understand. \u201cIt can be any combination of things,\u201d Stevens explained. \u201cIt can be an individual close-out gone wrong, it can be something that creates a scramble, it can be pick-and-roll defense where our bigs get beat, or it can be just a lack of rotation and help.\u201d Fixing the issue, however, is easier said than done. What it really comes down to is putting forth consistent effort and simply focusing on one defensive possession at a time. The C\u2019s will look to do just that during Friday night\u2019s rematch against Mitchell and the Jazz. \u201cEvery play is its own unique entity and we have to get better at all of it,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd hopefully we will. This is quite a challenge tonight because they have so many guys who can put the ball on the floor. There\u2019s so many threats on their team that can pull up at the three, and that makes it really hard to guard.\u201d It will also be a challenge because the Celtics are missing two of their best perimeter defenders in Jaylen Brown (strained hamstring) and Gordon Hayward (knee contusion). It will be up to the rest of the guys to correct the problem, as they try to complete a season sweep of the Jazz. - Taylor Snow "}

Even on his birthday. The 26-year-old guard provided his shorthanded Celtics squad with a much-needed 29 points Friday night, as they hosted a red-hot Utah Jazz team while playing without both Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward. He also treated fans inside TD Garden to a sharpshooting firework display, banging in six shots from beyond the 3-point arc. Smart\u2019s most important contribution of all, however, didn\u2019t show up on the stat sheet of the 99-94 loss. It was his gift of empowerment, specifically toward teammate Daniel Theis, that took the cake. Now, to be clear, the first part of this gift was handed out in brotherly fashion, meaning there was some tough love involved. After a couple of unsuccessful possessions near the start of the third quarter, a frustrated Smart approached Theis, got up in his grill and then started jawing away. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it appeared to be a heated moment between the two, but in reality, it was just Smart\u2019s way of instilling confidence within the third-year big man by encouraging him to be more aggressive on his rolls to the rim. \u201cI was just telling Daniel, 'You deserve to score the ball, so if you roll, you've got to roll so we can get you the ball so you can get some easy buckets because you work too hard not to get those easy buckets,'\u201d Smart later described. \u201cWhen Theis is rolling to the rim, he brings more intensity to our team and we're more aggressive because he's there. And if their big commits to the guards, we can dump it to him. Or if they don't, and we get the ball to the rim and the big contests it, he's there to clean it up. \u201cI just told him, \u2018You work too hard not to get those easy buckets. Let's get you some easy buckets and then step out to the 3. You deserve it.\u2019 And he agreed.\u201d Two possessions later, Theis set a pick for Kemba Walker, and then rolled toward the basket once the double-team came. Walker found him wide open, and he put in an and-one layup with ease. Smart was the first one to rush over to Theis, throwing his arms up in \u201cI-told-you-so\u201d fashion, before giving his teammate a huge bear hug and an encouraging pat on the chest. \u201cI let him know that [he does] so much,\u201d Smart said of Theis, who tallied 12 points and a game-high nine rebounds. \u201cOur bigs do a lot for us guards to get us shots, to get us shots, to get us open buckets, that they deserve the praise. And I just harped on it and I got on him, but then I wanted to let him know that, at the same time, you deserve it. I want you to know it and I want you to feel it and I want our bigs to know we really appreciate the work that they put in for us.\u201d Constant communication is something that Smart has harped upon since Day 1 this season. He encourages his teammates to always speak their mind, to always be willing to give and take constructive criticism in any moment, because he feels that doing so is critical toward success. \u201cThat's part of this team,\u201d Smart explained. \u201cWe're able to talk to guys, talk to each other, and keep it real. We don't sugarcoat anything with each other here. That's what makes us the team that we are.\u201d That\u2019s also what makes Smart such a critical leader for this Celtics team. He\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving in all areas of the game. "}

On Thursday, the Celtics ruled out forward Gordon Hayward (right knee contusion) and swingman Jaylen Brown (right hamstring strain) for the contest. The duo missed Boston's road win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday after sustaining their injuries in a stunning home loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night. Point guard Kemba Walker, who was held out Wednesday to rest his ailing left knee on the second night of a back-to-back, was not on Thursday's injury report. He and fellow All-Star Jayson Tatum will carry the load as the Celtics try to avoid their first three-game home losing streak since February 2018. The Jazz, meanwhile, enter on a three-game winning streak since losing to Boston at home on Feb. 26. The Friday matchup is the third of four games on an Eastern Conference road swing for Utah. Since that 114-103 setback against the Celtics last week, the Jazz have rebounded to restore order to their place in the Western Conference standings. Utah has beaten three clubs with losing records -- the Washington Wizards, Cleveland and New York Knicks -- as it vies for a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. \"No disrespect to the teams we've been playing, but these are games where we should come out on top,\" Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said after scoring 23 in a 112-104 win over the Knicks on Wednesday. \"We have a test coming up against Boston where we've got to keep the same energy. We've got to go out and continue to play the same way against tougher teams.\" Mitchell torched the Celtics for 37 points last week in an exhilarating battle with fellow 2017 draftee Tatum, who had 33 points and 11 rebounds in the Boston victory. The two went shot-for-shot during a stretch in the second quarter, leaving both teams with something to marvel about postgame. \"Those two guys are really good, aren't they?\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \"Sometimes I think we over-scrutinize the better players in this league. When you watch them do what those two were doing, not many people can do that.\" Tatum was sidelined due to an illness as the Celtics blew a 21-point, third-quarter lead and lost 129-120 in overtime to the Nets in their last home venture. The Eastern Conference Player of the Month for February returned Wednesday and put up 32 points, nine rebounds and six assists in a 112-106 victory over the Cavaliers. \"We could have made excuses because a lot of our guys aren't here, but we don't do that,\" Tatum said. \"I just tried to do my part. It was good to be out there.\" Stevens said Wednesday that Brown is expected to miss at least a week while Hayward is considered day-to-day. The Jazz got key contributions from Bojan Bogdanovic the past three games, as he averaged 24 points after he was limited to three points on 1-of-8 shooting vs. the Celtics. Boston is 23-7 at home; Utah is 18-13 away. "}

Boston coughed up an 18-point, fourth-quarter lead Tuesday before being outscored in overtime by the Brooklyn Nets, 11-2, in a 129-120 loss. The Celtics gave up 37 of Caris LeVert's 51 points in the final period and extra frame. \"I wouldn't say that [the Celtics let up down the stretch but coach] Brad [Stevens] definitely said we did,\" Kemba Walker told Boston.com after the game. \"[The Nets], they ramped it up. Obviously, LeVert, he was hot, he was making everything. It was an unbelievable performance by him.\" Brooklyn's comeback win marked Boston's second consecutive loss after suffering another overtime setback Saturday against Houston, 111-110. The Celtics surrendered 41 points to Rockets All-Star Russell Westbrook in that one, Boston's first home game after a 3-1 Western Conference road swing. Boston was without Walker against Houston, the last of five games missed after the All-Star break due to a sore knee. He returned Tuesday to score 21 points in the loss to Brooklyn, but will not make the trip to Cleveland on Wednesday, per the Boston Globe. The Celtics will also be without Jayson Tatum, who missed Tuesday's loss due to illness. The Boston Globe also reported Gordon Hayward spoke of soreness after playing just 17 minutes on Tuesday, and Jaylen Brown favored his right hamstring. With Marcus Smart facing a possible suspension for his post-game altercation with officials, Boston could be severely depleted against the Eastern Conference's last-place team. But while the Celtics seek to avoid their third three-game losing streak in the calendar year 2020 -- and to complete the season sweep of the Cavaliers -- Cleveland comes into Wednesday's matchup riding a three-game skid of its own. The Cavaliers lost on Monday to Utah, 126-113. The defeat dropped Cleveland one game behind Atlanta for the East's worst record. Cleveland surged to 3-1 after the All-Star break under J.B. Bickerstaff, who replaced embattled first-year coach John Beilein. Beilein announced his resignation Feb. 19 after a contentious few months on the job. The Cavaliers' initial success under Bickerstaff included wins over Miami and Philadelphia, two teams in the hunt for first-round home-court advantages in the NBA Playoffs. Despite the losing streak, Cleveland has seen positives from second-year guard Collin Sexton. On Monday, he broke the career-high of 31 points he set just three days prior to New Orleans scoring 32 points against the Jazz. \"He had a great overall game,\" Bickerstaff said of Sexton following Monday's loss. \"He scored when the opportunity presented itself, then he made the right play when he had to. Defensively, he battled, too.\" At 20.2 points per game, Sexton leads a Cavaliers team that heads into Wednesday's matchup with injury-ravaged Boston facing a rash of its own maladies. Cleveland played with Andre Drummond, Tristan Thompson, Darius Garland, Alfonzo McKinnie and Dante Exum on Monday. Just nine Cavaliers suited up in the loss. "}

However, with three of their top four scorers sidelined Wednesday night in Cleveland, the C\u2019s needed their third-year wing to step up on the offensive end, as well. Ojeleye answered the call in tremendous fashion, pouring in a career-high 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field during 30 minutes of action off the bench. More importantly, he came through with the biggest shot of the night \u2013 a game-sealing 3-pointer during crunch time, which helped Boston outlast the Cavaliers, 112-106, despite being without injured starters Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker. Ojeleye did more than half of his offensive damage during the second quarter when he notched 12 points on a perfect 4-for-4 effort from the field, which included three makes from downtown. By halftime, he had 15 points, which placed him just two shy of his previous career-high of 17. While his scoring outpour may have shocked some viewers, Ojeleye\u2019s teammates weren\u2019t the least bit surprised. \u201cWe knew Semi could do that on a daily basis for us,\u201d declared Marcus Smart, who logged 18 points during the win. \u201cEvery day he\u2019s getting his shots up. He\u2019s knocking down those shots in practice, warmups and everything. It was just all about his opportunity tonight. He got his opportunity and he took advantage of it.\u201d Ojeleye\u2019s opportunities haven\u2019t always come always consistently. For example, during Tuesday night\u2019s loss against Brooklyn, he didn\u2019t see a single minute of action until overtime, by which time the C\u2019s were without Brown, Hayward and Walker. Though, having an unpredictable role doesn\u2019t cause Ojeleye\u2019s approach to waver. \u201cYou try to take advantage of when you get an opportunity like this, and when there\u2019s not, you just keep working,\u201d he explained. The long hours that Ojeleye puts in at the gym don\u2019t go unnoticed, as his coaches and teammates often rave about his work ethic. That\u2019s part of what made his performance Wednesday night effort extraordinary. \"He's the best,\u201d said coach Brad Stevens. \u201cHe's a great worker, he's a great teammate. When everything is not going your way, he's a guy that you know is in everybody's corner, and I think that that's huge when you start talking about team. And you also know he can not play one night and be effective in his role the next.\u201d Ojeleye also displayed great perseverance during Wednesday night\u2019s win, as he played through an injury of his own. Late in the second quarter, he collapsed to the court in excruciating pain after taking a knee to the groin while defending a drive by Larry Nance Jr. The team listed him as being \u201cquestionable to return\u201d at halftime, but he re-entered the action midway through the third quarter and wound up playing the final 17-plus minutes of the game. \u201cIt was just an uncomfortable situation,\u201d Ojeleye said of the injury. \u201cBut I just wanted to get back out there because we needed the win.\u201d And the Celtics may not have gotten the win without him. Ojeleye scored seven more points after halftime, including a critical corner triple at the 2:15 mark of the fourth quarter which put his squad ahead 103-97. \u201cSemi played great,\u201d said Jayson Tatum, who stuffed the stat sheet with 32 points, nine rebounds, six assists, and two steals. \u201cHe hit big shots. He hit the shot that really kind of like sealed the game. He works his butt off. He doesn't always play, but when his name is called, he steps up, and he was a big reason why we won tonight.\" Stepping up in the manner which he did was a huge confidence booster for Ojeleye. It\u2019s not easy being in a position of not always having a consistent role. But being able to show off a side of his game that he works at so diligently made it all worth it. In fact, it made him want work even harder. \u201cIt just felt like a relief,\u201d Ojeleye said. \u201cKind of like a weight off your shoulders knowing that you put in the work and you finally get to let it show for a little bit. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time to put in more work.\u201d "}

Brooklyn scored 51 points during the final frame, including five during the final six seconds to tie the game up in miraculous fashion. With momentum on its side, it then pulled away in OT for a 129-120 win. The C\u2019s were leading 118-113 with less than 10 seconds remaining in regulation, but allowed the Nets to score easily on a Caris LeVert-to-DeAndre Jordan alley-oop slam to bring the score within three. Boston then called a timeout to advance the ball up to mid-court, where it would experience great difficulty inbounding the ball. On the first attempt, Grant Williams couldn't find an open man in time, so he was forced to call a timeout before being called for a five-second violation. On the second attempt, Marcus Smart found Kemba Walker, but Walker was immediately swarmed by Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Rodions Kurucs and the refs called for a jump ball. Kurucs, who has 10 inches on Walker, won the tip, and Brooklyn called for a timeout with 1.4 seconds remaining. Spencer Dinwiddie then inbounded the ball to a red-hot LeVert, who was triple-teamed right away by Smart, Daniel Theis and Robert Williams. As he rose up for the last-second heave, LeVert was hit on the left hand by Smart, causing the referee to blow the whistle to send him to the free-throw line with 0.2 seconds remaining. While under extreme pressure, LeVert sunk all three freebies to send the game into OT. The Celtics would enter the extra period at an extreme disadvantage, as they were without three of their starters. Both Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward had both suffered injuries during the game, and Walker, in his first game back from injury, had reached his minutes limitation by the end of the fourth quarter. To make matters even more difficult, Smart fouled out just a little over a minute into overtime, leaving Theis as Boston's only remaining starter. The Nets took full advantage of the opportunity by outscoring Boston 11-2 during the extra five minutes, which allowed them to walk away with a 129-120 victory. Two words can sum up Brooklyn's remarkable 18-point comeback: Caris LeVert. The 25-year-old wing turned in the best performance of his life, as he tallied a career-high 51 points while shooting 17-of-26 shooting from the field and 12-of-18 from the free-throw line. Amazingly, LeVert only had 14 points at the end of three quarters before erupting for 37 during the fourth quarter and overtime combined. His most critical points came with 0.2 seconds left in regulation, as he was fouled on a 3-pointer and then sunk all three free-throws to send the game into overtime. LeVert also tallied five assists and four rebounds during the effort, while logging a plus 15. No other Nets starter recorded better than a minus-16. Brad Stevens on the loss. "}

Hard work does pay off. Ojeleye was ready and wide-open in the right corner of the court when Jayson Tatum hit him with a drive-and-kick pass with 2:17 left in the game. Boston led by three but would soon lead by six. Ojeleye doubled his team\u2019s advantage by catching Tatum\u2019s pass and immediately firing up a shot that rolled around the inside of the rim and quickly fell through the net. Much of Boston\u2019s bench was standing up by the time the ball fell through, because it was celebrating a perfect possession by the C\u2019s. Cleveland had trapped Tatum on the right wing, and he tossed the ball over the trap to Daniel Theis at the right elbow. Theis then kicked it out to Brad Wanamaker on the left wing, who immediately swung it to Marcus Smart in the left corner. This is when Boston\u2019s offense put Cleveland\u2019s defense into a bind. Smart caught the ball and quickly drove baseline past his defender, who was attempting to close out on what could have been a 3-point attempt. Smart drew multiple defenders as he broke into the paint, kicked it out to Tatum on the right wing, and then Tatum drove it again before kicking out to Ojeleye for the 3-pointer. This possession was, quite literally, perfection. \u201cSemi\u2019s shot-making was critical to it, because otherwise, you can be as spaced as you want, but if nobody\u2019s going to make [the 3-pointers] around the passing, or the dive or the big that rolls, then they can just help,\u201d Brad Stevens said after the game. \u201cSo Semi was a huge, huge part of being able to spray it like that.\u201d The Celtics soon added to their six-point lead when Marcus Smart dropped a floater in at the 1:27 mark to make it a 105-97 game. Smart made the shot after Daniel Theis tipped out an offensive rebound off of a missed trey from Tatum. Boston controlled the final 87 seconds after that to close out a 112-106 win. That might not have been the case had Ojeleye not made the most important shot of the game. With three of his fellow starters missing Wednesday\u2019s game against the Cavaliers, Jayson Tatum, who himself was returning from a one-game absence due to an illness, knew he had to continue his hot streak. So that\u2019s exactly what he did. Tatum scored 30 or more points in his fifth straight game and for the eighth time in his last 11 games by dropping 32 on the Cavaliers. That total led the Celtics by a wide margin, as Semi Ojeleye finished second on the team with 22 points. Tatum shot 11-for-24 from the field and canned five of his 10 attempts from long distance during nearly 40 minutes of action. It wasn\u2019t his most efficient shooting night, but he was still able to command double-teams and traps throughout the contest, which led to balanced offense from the C\u2019s. Tatum missed his 11th double-double of the season by just one rebound. He finished with nine, to go along with six assists, two seals and a blocked shot.

Tatum, who today celebrates his 22nd birthday, averaged a team-high 30.7 points (49.4% FG, 48.1% 3-PT), 7.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.3 blocked shots to help guide Boston to a 9-3 record for the month. The St. Louis, MO native was one of two NBA players and the only Eastern Conference competitor to average at least 30.0 points and 7.0 rebounds in February (Westbrook).

Walker is probable after returning to practice Monday following a five-game absence with left knee soreness. He last played Feb. 13 and is expected to be under a minutes restriction if he does take the court. \"It's going to be tough playing limited minutes,\" he said. \"But it's all about the long haul and being healthy when it counts, so that's what I'm looking forward to. Just working my way toward getting healthy as we get toward the end of the year.\" Even if he's limited, Walker could be crucial for the Celtics with forward Jayson Tatum and guard Marcus Smart each questionable against the Nets due to illness. Tatum and Smart were added to the injury report after missing practice Monday. \"I don't have any idea,\" coach Brad Stevens said of the duo's availability. Such has been a constant for the Celtics this season as short-term ailments have kept the team's starting five from playing together on a regular basis. Still, Boston is among the top teams in the Eastern Conference, with wins in 14 of its last 18 games. The Celtics will be looking to bounce back after a 111-110 overtime loss to the Houston Rockets on Saturday that snapped their seven-game home winning streak. Boston is 23-6 at home. The Nets, meanwhile, enter having lost five of six, including their last four in a row. Tuesday marks the end of a four-game road trip for Brooklyn, which will return home for three straight beginning Wednesday. The Nets will again be without Kyrie Irving in their second and final trip to Boston. Irving, who played for the Celtics the past two seasons, missed the first trip with a shoulder injury and is now out for the season after it was determined in late February that he would undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. General manager Sean Marks said the decision was made \"looking at the big picture\" despite his team's current status as the No. 8 seed in the East. \"This is something that he should be back in plenty of time to be working out this summer and obviously be ready for next season,\" said Marks. Despite their slide, the Nets still have a four-game edge on the Washington Wizards in the East standings. Brooklyn rallied from 14 points down in the fourth quarter to get within one in the final seconds before ultimately losing 116-113 to the Miami Heat on Saturday. \"Winning is one of those things that is a confidence thing,\" said swingman Joe Harris at practice Monday. \"Once you get one win under your belt against a quality team, that can translate into another win. That's why tomorrow's game is so important for us.\" Nets guard Garrett Temple is questionable for Tuesday's game with a right shoulder sprain. The Nets and Celtics have split their two meetings this season, each team winning at home. They'll conclude their season series on March 21 in Brooklyn. "}

The star point guard missed the last five games due to nagging left knee soreness that has continued to flare up over the course of the season. Though, with the swelling now gone, he hopes to return to action as soon as Tuesday night when the C\u2019s host the Brooklyn Nets at TD Garden. \u201cI'm looking forward to that,\u201d Walker said of the possibility while flipping a basketball back and forth between his hands after practice. Aren\u2019t we all? Even though the Celtics managed to win three of their last five games without Walker, they certainly missed his presence on the offensive end. One could only wonder how things would have fared if he had been in the lineup during their one-possession losses to both the Lakers and the Rockets this past week. \u201cHe just has the ability to make plays with very simple spacing because of his speed, quickness, and skill,\u201d said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. \u201cI think that, you can tell in games like we\u2019ve had over the last week, where it\u2019s hard to score at times, that\u2019s when you miss his burst and that motor.\u201d Walker\u2019s burst and motor will only be available in a limited capacity for now, as he works his way back on an undetermined minutes restriction. The eager veteran doesn\u2019t love the idea of having to operate under such circumstances, but he\u2019s also willing to do whatever it takes to be in tip-top shape by the time the postseason rolls around. \u201cIt's going to be tough playing limited minutes,\u201d Walker admitted. \u201cBut it's all about the long haul and being healthy when it counts, so that's what I'm looking forward to. Just working my way toward getting healthy as we get toward the end of the year.\u201d Walker isn\u2019t used to being in such a situation. He missed a total of eight games in February, which was two more than he had missed in his previous four seasons combined. The knee soreness has without a doubt caused great frustration, though he also accepts the fact that every athlete\u2019s body breaks down from time to time. \u201cI\u2019ve played a lot of basketball over the years. It happens,\u201d said Walker. \u201cI've been blessed over the course of my career to be pretty healthy, but it happens, man. We all get injured at some point. Just gotta deal with it.\u201d How he\u2019s dealing with it is just by being more careful with his workload and making sure that he\u2019s being consistent with his rehab. \u201cI\u2019m just being conscious,\u201d he said. \u201cJust busy taking care of myself, that\u2019s really it. I can\u2019t really take any days off. I can\u2019t skip any treatments, any lifts, just stay on top of it and I\u2019ll be good.\u201d Walker may, however, have to skip a game here and there. For example, if he plays Tuesday night, it would be unlikely to see him suit up the following night in Cleveland. In situations when he has to sit out, Walker is confident that his teammates would be able to fill his role to the best of their abilities, just as they\u2019ve done over the past month. \u201cThey've been playing great,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cPlaying hard, playing together, competing at a very high level. I just need to add to it as much as I can.\u201d Walker hopes to make such an addition Tuesday night by returning to action against the division-rival Nets. "}

His miraculous, game-tying 3-point blow at the buzzer momentarily stunned the visiting Houston Rockets, who had been in control for most of the second half of the nationally televised fight. In that moment, Brown\u2019s shot seemed to have swung the momentum in Boston\u2019s favor. But in the end, Houston\u2019s physicality prevailed. The Rockets withstood the blow, maintained their composure throughout overtime, and then walked out of TD Garden with a 111-110 victory. \u201cI thought the right team won,\u201d C\u2019s coach Brad Stevens admitted after the game. \u201cTheir physical presence is real, so I think that when they turned it up a notch physically in the second half, we got stagnant because they were imposing their will on the game, and they can do that. It\u2019s not a knock on our guys necessarily by any means. It\u2019s just that that\u2019s the strength of their team.\u201d The Celtics started off as the stronger team, as they took a 56-45 lead into halftime. That all changed after the break, however, as Houston turned up its physicality and dominated the third quarter, 36-22. \u201cThat\u2019s just one of their advantages,\u201d said Jayson Tatum, who finished with a team-high 32 points. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a bunch of guys that are around the same size, kind of big and strong. It was just a physical game both ways. The refs were letting us play at both ends, so we were just going at it.\u201d Though, it\u2019s not easy to keep going at it against a brawny group that Stevens on several occasions has referred to as \u201ca bunch of linebackers.\u201d Still, the Celtics managed to hold their ground all the way to the end. Boston rallied from a six-point deficit during the final 36 seconds of regulation, saving its most incredible play for last. Houston was up three with five seconds remaining when it decided to intentionally foul Jayson Tatum. He went to the line and missed his first attempt, and then purposely missed the second with the hope that he or one of his teammates would collect the rebound off the rim. Sure enough, Marcus Smart was there to bat the ball out to Brown, who rose up from beyond the arc and sunk the tying bucket as time expired. \u201cWe actually go over those situations in practice,\u201d explained Brown, who finished with 22 points. \u201cTrying to get it down, hit it off the rim and see what happens, and the shot went in.\u201d Brown also had the ball in his hands during the closing seconds of overtime with his Celtics down one. However, his step-back, free-throw-line jumper came up short, caroming off the front iron and into the hands of Daniel Theis, who couldn\u2019t get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded. \u201cHe got a clean look at the rim and we believe in him and trust him,\u201d Stevens said of Brown\u2019s final shot. Though, the game wasn\u2019t lost in that moment. The defeat traced back to Boston\u2019s inability to combat Houston\u2019s physicality, particularly when it came to crashing the glass during crunch time. \u201cWe have to become a little bit better at holding our ground,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cPart of it is just the brute strength and part of it is picking your spots a little bit better, getting angles a little bit better. Then I think the other thing that\u2019s always a great reminder is that that possession is never over until you have the ball. And they killed us on the glass in the third and fourth quarters from the corners and slashing and crashing. Those were big, huge plays.\u201d The Celtics will surely revisit those plays in the film room over the next couple of days, so that way the next time they face a similar challenge, they\u2019ll be better prepared. \u201cWe still have another level we can go to,\u201d Brown suggested optimistically. \u201cTonight we fell short, but it's another good learning lesson, another great game for us to build off of and learn.\u201d "}
{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/post-ups-20200229", "article": " BOSTON \u2013 Jayson Tatum has taken quite a leap over the last few weeks, as he\u2019s transformed from a budding star into one of the most feared offensive players in the NBA. Yet, coach Brad Stevens believes that the 21-year-old wing is still not even close to reaching his full potential. As Tatum continues to grow, teams will adjust the way in which they defend him. And he, in turn, will figure out how to combat those defensive adjustments. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of room to improve which is good,\u201d Stevens said before hosting the Houston Rockets Saturday night. \u201cWe saw that on the West Coast in the Lakers game when he saw a bunch of doubles, and we watched those all as a team. And then in the Utah game I thought he was way better against them, and that\u2019s just because he sees some of that stuff for the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about the special players in the league \u2013 and (James) Harden\u2019s a good example of this; he\u2019s seen everything. But he\u2019s seen it for years and years and years now. And even the doubles that maybe haven\u2019t come as frequently as they do now, he\u2019s seen them at times over the last couple of years.\u201d What separates Tatum from many other players, Stevens believes, is the unwavering mental approach that allows him to be great at any moment coupled with his ability to learn how to adjust on the fly to whatever opposing defenses through at him. Those strengths have been a part of Tatum\u2019s makeup since the day he put on a Celtics uniform. \u201cI always remember one of his first exhibition games, Charlotte ran a play that a lot of NBA teams run, and we had not gone through it in any way,\u201d Stevens recalled. \u201cHe got burned on the first one. And on the second one he figured it out. And that\u2019s why I think he has a chance to be really special. \u201cBut,\u201d the coach added, \u201che\u2019d be the first to tell you he\u2019s not finished and he can still get a lot better. Because he\u2019s going to see all this new stuff.\u201d And when Tatum sees something new, he\u2019ll be able to adapt, just like he always has. Which is one of the many reasons why he is only just beginning his climb toward greatness. - Taylor Snow "}

The Celtics return from a 3-1 road trip that ended Wednesday with a 114-103 victory over the Utah Jazz. Boston is 23-5 at home this season, its last loss at TD Garden coming Jan. 18. The Rockets, meanwhile, have won five straight and scored north of 120 points in each of their last four. Houston is 17-12 on the road this season. The teams met in Houston on Feb. 11 with the Rockets pulling away in the third quarter on their way to a 116-105 victory. James Harden had 42 points, and Russell Westbrook scored 36 with 10 rebounds. Gordon Hayward paced the Celtics with 20. Jayson Tatum had just 15 points in that game, his only outing where he scored less than 20 in his last 15 games. Tatum has taken his offensive game to the next level of late, highlighted by three straight games shooting over 60 percent with more than 30 points to finish Boston's West Coast swing. \"We're in a good spot,\" Tatum said after putting up 33 points and 11 rebounds in the win over the Jazz. \"We're just trying to continue to get better every game.\" Tatum's surge has come at a good time for the Celtics, who have been without fellow All-Star Kemba Walker (knee injury) since Feb. 13. The team is targeting Tuesday against the Brooklyn Nets for the guard's return. \"I think the plan of attack is for him to go harder in the morning, maybe even ramp it up Sunday and then go from there,\" coach Brad Stevens told reporters Friday. \"So hopefully back by Tuesday, but out for tomorrow is what I've heard last.\" Stevens added that big man Robert Williams III, out since early December with a hip injury, could be cleared to play Saturday. Similar to Tatum, Westbrook has been surging for the Rockets, with 30 or more points in nine of his last 11 contests. After missing a win over the New York Knicks on Monday with a thumb injury, Westbrook returned to action with team highs of 33 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 140-112 blowout of the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. \"The excitement that he brings to the game, I just don't know another player in the league who brings that kind of intensity and is actually skilled,\" said Harden, who added 30 points in just 28 minutes of play against Memphis. Harden has been just as dangerous of late, surpassing 30 points in eight of his last 11 contests. His 35.2 points per game leads the league by a wide margin. \"Those guys are two of the best in the world,\" Stevens said after the last meeting in Houston. The Rockets have won four straight in their season series with the Celtics. "}

The reason being that the sophomore big man had just received clearance to return to game action after missing nearly three months with a bone edema in his left hip. \u201cYou can tell, he\u2019s been antsy to go for a while now,\u201d the Celtics\u2019 head coach told the media. \u201cSo we\u2019re happy that he\u2019s going to be able to be back.\u201d Williams first returned to practice last Wednesday, just before leaving with the team for Minnesota. He gradually ramped up his activity throughout the weeklong road trip with the hope of being cleared in time for Saturday night\u2019s home matchup against the Houston Rockets. Having achieved that goal, Williams could provide a nice boost for the Celtics in a limited capacity against a fast-paced Houston team that beat the Celtics by double digits just before the All-Star break. \u201cRob\u2019s a pretty mobile guy,\u201d Stevens said, looking ahead to Saturday night\u2019s matchup. \u201cHe can move with guards and wings, so he may get some minutes tomorrow. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Stevens anticipates that Williams\u2019 minutes will be heavily restricted for at least a couple of games, as the 22-year-old big man works his way back into game shape. \u201cBut it\u2019s great news, obviously,\u201d the coach said of having Williams back in the rotation. \u201cWe\u2019re excited, nobody more so than Rob.\u201d With Williams returning, Boston is just one body away from being 100 percent healthy. Kemba Walker, who has been dealing with nagging left knee soreness, is the only injured Celtic remaining. Though he, too, appears to be just a few days away from returning to action. \u201cI think the plan of attack is for him to go harder in the morning, maybe even ramp it up Sunday and then go from there,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cSo hopefully back by Tuesday (against Brooklyn), but out for tomorrow is what I\u2019ve heard last.\u201d Walker\u2019s knee soreness has forced him to miss eight games since the middle of January, including the entire four-game trip that his Celtics just completed. Stevens is not overly concerned about the injury, but also wants to make sure that his star point guard is feeling 100 percent healthy before returning to the court. \u201cThe goal is to have him feeling great,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cNot just be ready, but feeling great. And so, when he gets back, you\u2019re not doing the back and forth as much of sitting a few. Now, if he were to come back next week, I don\u2019t anticipate him playing the (full) back-to-back (against Brooklyn and Cleveland). But I do think that once he gets back on the court, it\u2019s because he feels great.\u201d When that day comes, the Celtics will likely be feeling great as well. Because now that Williams is finally back, the Celtics are just one sore knee away from being 100 percent healthy. "}

That, at least, is according to the longest-tenured Celtic, Marcus Smart. \u201cFor me being here, it\u2019s No. 1,\u201d Smart said Wednesday night, after the Celtics quieted the Jazz for their 14th win in their last 17 games, dating back to Jan. 20. He added, \u201cI think the way that we\u2019ve been playing is at top-notch level since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d Now some, including Jayson Tatum for a brief moment Wednesday night, will point to Boston\u2019s 16-game win streak at the start of the 2017-18 season as more impressive. But not even that run was as convincing as the wave the Celtics are currently riding. The reasons why are threefold. First and foremost are the raw wins. Boston has won 14 of 17, and nine of those wins have come against teams currently qualified for the playoffs. Six of the teams that Boston has beaten are currently seeded sixth or higher in their respective conference. The C\u2019s are beating great teams thanks to strong play from every player who\u2019s in the rotation. \u201cEverybody\u2019s playing well,\u201d Tatum said Wednesday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s contributing.\u201d For comparison\u2019s sake, the 2017-18 streak featured only seven wins over eventual playoff teams. The next reason why this stretch is most impressive is because the Celtics now have a bona fide superstar on their roster who is torching opponents and dominating games. Jayson Tatum has made the leap \u2013 err, leaps \u2013 this season. He has gone from budding star, to All-Star, to superstar in a matter of months. Tatum is averaging 29.0 points per game since Jan. 20. He has scored at least 25 points during 11 of the 14 games in which he\u2019s appeared, and he has scored at least 30 points during six of those games, including Wednesday\u2019s 33-point performance in Utah. Tatum is averaging 30.5 PPG during February, the fifth-highest average in the NBA. Again, for comparison\u2019s sake, Boston\u2019s leading scorer during the 16-game win streak was Kyrie Irving, at 22.9 PPG. Lastly, but maybe most important to Boston\u2019s success, is the fact that this Celtics team is showcasing a championship level of resiliency. Amid this stretch since Jan. 20, Kemba Walker has missed seven games, Enes Kanter has missed five games, Jaylen Brown has missed four games, Tatum has missed three games, Smart and Daniel Theis have missed two games, and Gordon Hayward has missed one game. That\u2019s 24 games missed by seven of arguably Boston\u2019s top eight players. Yet here the Celtics are, winners of 14 of 17 after an impressive win against the Jazz. Boston just keeps finding ways to win, as it did in convincing fashion Wednesday night despite facing a long list of obstacles. \u201cIt\u2019s a big win on a back-to-back in a tough environment against a team that was desperate for a win,\u201d said Brown, who forgot to mention that the C\u2019s were also without Walker, were playing for the third time in four nights, and were closing out a West Coast swing at high altitude. \u201cIt don\u2019t get too much better than that.\u201d It most certainly does not, and that\u2019s why the Celtics are flying back to Boston with a confidence level that has reached new heights. Over the last five weeks, this Celtics team has beaten many of the top teams that the NBA has to offer. It has watched its 21-year-old phenom turn into a superstar. It has showcased a championship level of resiliency. Trust the words that came out of Smart\u2019s mouth Wednesday night. This is the most impressive stretch of regular-season basketball that the Celtics have played in recent memory. "}

The teams entered the final period separated by just three points on the scoreboard, but less than five minutes into the frame Boston had added 10 points to its advantage. Marcus Smart was at the core of the game-changing run, as he scored nine of Boston\u2019s 15 points and assisted on two more. From the 9:42 mark to the 7:44 mark of the quarter \u2013 less than two minutes, we must point out \u2013 Smart canned three 3-pointers on as many attempts to push the Celtics ahead 98-87. All three treys were canned from the left wing. The first 3-pointer came in transition, after Utah forgot to defend him. The second was released from well beyond the arc after Brad Wanamaker swung the ball to him on the wing. The third came after Grant Williams freed Smart up with a beautiful screen. Most who watch the Celtics on a regular basis expected Smart to let it fly the next time he touched the ball, no matter where he was on the court when he touched it. Let\u2019s be real: he\u2019s known for his heat checks. But instead of forcing up a contested 3 from the left corner in transition, Smart rewarded a sprinting Enes Kanter with a wrap-around bounce pass that set Kanter up for an easy layup in the paint. Kanter\u2019s bucket pushed Boston ahead 100-87 with 7:22 left in the game. The C\u2019s would eventually pull ahead by as many as 15 points before closing out a 114-103 win. Jayson Tatum did it again Wednesday night. For the third straight game and for the sixth time this month, Tatum broke the 30-point barrier. This time, he dropped a team-best 33 points on the Utah Jazz. Tatum continued his red-hot shooting this month by connecting on 13 of his 20 field goal attempts. He has now made at least 12 field goals in three straight games. The attention will be rightfully placed on Tatum\u2019s hot scoring, but what cannot be ignored is that he also tallied his ninth double-double of the season. Tatum recorded a game-high 11 rebounds during the contest, two more than any other player \u2013 including Rudy Gobert, who entered the game ranked second in the NBA in rebounding average. Tatum rounded out his box score with three assists during 38-plus minutes of action. Boston outscored Utah by eight points while he was on the floor. Brad Stevens on Boston's recent success "}

The 29-year-old is enjoying a turn-back-the-clock campaign two seasons after suffering a career-threatening broken leg in his Celtics debut in 2017. Hayward contributed 12 points and five rebounds to Boston's 118-106 victory at Portland on Tuesday in the opener of a back-to-back. No Celtics player was pressed into more than 34 minutes of duty in the win, including Hayward, who went just 31. He will enter Wednesday's game averaging 17.3 points while shooting a career-high 50.8 percent. An All-Star in 2017, his final season with the Jazz, Hayward has visited Utah just once previously since signing a four-year, $128 million free-agent contract with Boston. Only 11 games removed from having to sit out the final 81 games of the 2017-18 season, Hayward had 13 points and seven assists in 26 minutes in a 123-115 loss at Utah in November 2018. The Jazz also won at Boston 98-86 eight days later, sweeping the season series for the first time since 2006-07. Hayward had just seven points and four rebounds in the rematch. The Celtics have alternated wins and losses in the first three games of their trip, sandwiching a narrow defeat in Los Angeles against the Lakers on Sunday with victories at Minnesota and Portland. They'd love to get All-Star point guard Kemba Walker in the lineup for the first time on the trip in Utah, but Celtics coach Brad Stevens noted Monday that his title-contending club would rather err on the side of caution with the veteran's sore knee. \"What he's doing is exactly what we said: Strengthening and working out hard and trying to make it so it doesn't become a back-and-forth thing,\" Stevens explained to reporters. \"That's the goal. Let's do it now, strengthen it, make it as good as it can be, then we can ramp up accordingly as we head into the stretch run.\" The Celtics will be encountering a Jazz team that's been struggling. After opening a six-game homestand with a win over Miami, Utah has been beaten in succession by San Antonio, Houston and Phoenix. The last of those games, a 131-111 drubbing Monday, was most disheartening not only in that it was at the hands of a team with a losing record, but also in that the Suns put up the second-most points scored by a Jazz opponent this season. Utah, which began the season by holding its first five opponents under 100 points, has now allowed 12 of its last 13 foes to score in triple figures, including the last seven in a row. \"We're gonna keep getting the same result if we don't focus and execute on the defensive end,\" Jazz coach Quin Snyder insisted to reporters after Monday's loss. \"This is a group that's done that. But that doesn't matter right now. What that should tell us is that we're capable, at least on some level. But right now that's not who we are.

After all, the Blazers did jump out to a 7-0 lead over the first minute and a half of the game. The final 46 and a half minutes, however, belonged to Boston. The Celtics led by eight points at the break and pulled away for good during the latter portion of the third quarter. They led 65-60 at the 7:46 mark and nearly doubled that by the end of the frame. Boston finished the third period on a 20-10 run, paced by its typical balanced scoring attack. Five different Celtics combined to score the 20 points, led by nine from Jayson Tatum. Boston\u2019s young star scored the first seven points of the spurt, and then closed it with the final two. The other 11 points were scored by Jaylen Brown, who notched five, and Gordon Hayward, Daniel Theis and Brad Wanamaker, who scored two apiece. Boston never let up during the fourth quarter, and in fact, it continued to pull away. The Celtics led by as many as 19 points during the final period before pulling all five of their starters with 2:56 remaining in the contest. The team\u2019s reserves helped the C\u2019s close out a 118-106 victory. Another game, another superstar performance from Jayson Tatum. Tatum continued his recent hot streak by dropping a game-high 36 points Tuesday night in Portland, marking his fifth game of at least 30 points this month and his 10th such game this season. Tatum shot 14-for-22 from the field and 8-for-12 from 3-point range. Tatum is now averaging 30.3 points per game during February on 50 percent shooting from the field, 49.5 percent shooting from 3-point range, and 77.8 percent shooting from the free-throw line. In addition to his game-high scoring total, Tatum also led the Celtics in blocks with two. He rounded out his box score by adding in five rebounds and one assist during his 34-plus minutes of action.

Right now, Jayson Tatum is being thrown into the fire with that regard. While tying his career high with 41 points Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles, Tatum faced more traps and double-teams than he has ever seen before. Brad Stevens said ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s game against the Trail Blazers that 90 percent of the traps the team has faced this season were sent at Kemba Walker, so Tatum and the rest of the team are learning how to deal with such schemes being thrown at the 21-year-old star. \u201cHe\u2019s got to get off it quick. That\u2019s something he learns as he looks at film,\u201d Stevens said of Tatum\u2019s development against traps. \u201cIt was fun to look at the film yesterday and say, \u2018OK, these are the (James) Harden traps. This is where the traps are coming from. We\u2019ve got the ball in the perfect place for our team. Now it\u2019s just about getting off of it quick.\u2019\u201d What Stevens means by \u201cgetting off of it quick\u201d is that Tatum must make the right read and get the ball to a the right teammate at the right time. He must diagnose where the trap is coming from, and which teammate will be open as a result of that trap. Stevens said that once Tatum makes the read and gets the ball off of the trap quickly, the pressure then shifts to Tatum\u2019s teammate to correctly attack a rotating defense. \u201cAnd then the first guy out of that pass needs to be able to do something with it, whether that\u2019s drive it, make an extra pass, shoot it, whatever the case may be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t hold it.\u201d Stevens confirmed Tuesday night what many have commented on all season, and that is that the Boston Celtics should be a very difficult team to trap as a result of all of the playmakers they have on their roster. In addition to Tatum and Walker, two All-Stars, Boston also has the likes of Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Marcus Smart. When healthy, at least two of those five players will almost always occupy the court at the same time. Opponents will have a very difficult time defending the C\u2019s if players like Walker and Tatum make the right reads out of those traps. Tatum dealt with traps well as a first-timer Sunday afternoon, and he\u2019ll undoubtedly improve as time goes on. As Stevens commented Tuesday night, \u201cI think he\u2019s getting more thrown at him every game, and as you can tell, there\u2019s a hunger to continue to improve.\u201d Tatum may see another healthy dose of traps tonight, as the Celtics play for the third straight game without Walker. This game against Portland will serve as another learning opportunity for Boston\u2019s budding superstar. - Marc D'Amico "}

{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/post-ups-20200226", "article": " SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 There have been three nights this month during which Enes Kanter has played 20 or more minutes for the Boston Celtics. There have also been three nights during which he has played fewer than 10 minutes. He\u2019s not letting those sporadic minutes affect him on a daily basis, according to Brad Stevens. Stevens was asked before Wednesday night\u2019s game in Salt Lake City, where Kanter spent the first three and a half seasons of his career, about how Kanter has impacted the Celtics this season. One of the first things Stevens pointed out is the positivity Kanter brings to the table every day, regardless of his role. \u201cThere are some games where we\u2019ve really leaned on him heavy, and there are some games where we haven\u2019t as much,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a great teammate all the way through, which I think is one of his great qualities. \"Obviously he\u2019s a great rebounder, he\u2019s a great scorer, he can do all that stuff,\" the coach continued, \"but he brings a good, positive energy every day.\" If any franchise knows how difficult it is for players to be great teammates while their role is in flux, it\u2019s the Celtics. They just went through a bumpy season last year that was heavily impacted by players who struggled to adjust to new and varying roles. Kanter has avoided such struggles, which says a lot about who he is as both a player and a person. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest position to be in in the league, is the guy that doesn\u2019t know exactly when he\u2019s going to play or how much he\u2019s going to play.\u201d Stevens then went on to explain that Kanter\u2019s minutes are only going to become more sporadic in the coming weeks, when the Celtics work Rob Williams back into the lineup after his lengthy absence due to a sore left hip. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to kind\u2019ve attack this with multiple guys and almost like a hockey-sub idea when we get to fully healthy at that position,\u201d Stevens said of the center position. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda the plan of attack going into the year, and we haven\u2019t been healthy enough.\u201d Evidence that has been gathered throughout this season suggests that Kanter will be able to adjust to whatever role he is assigned each night once Williams returns to the lineup. Kanter has done so with a positive attitude all season long, and no one expects that to change. Nor will Boston\u2019s need for Kanter to provide size, strength, rebounding and interior scoring against particular opponents. They need those abilities, and Kanter will be ready to provide them whenever Stevens calls his name. - Marc D'Amico "}

His performance has done the talking and has reminded everyone that there are two budding stars in Boston, not just one. Brown continued one of the best months of his career Tuesday night in Portland by scoring 24 points during a win over the Trail Blazers. He is now averaging 22.0 points per game during February, which trails only his average of 22.9 PPG during December for the top scoring month of his career. Brown has also raised his season scoring average up to 20.4 PPG, which isn\u2019t too far behind Tatum\u2019s team-leading average of 23.1 PPG. Yet amid his own rise to stardom \u2013 Brown is now a top-30 scorer in the NBA \u2013 the fourth-year wing gladly sings praise to his teammates, like Tatum, while his performances oftentimes fall to the back burner. \u201cYou gotta want for your brother what you want for yourself,\u201d he told Celtics.com. How refreshing is that mindset? There is not a selfish bone in Brown\u2019s body. He is selfless, fully invested in placing the team\u2019s success above his own. Such characteristics have turned Brown into a leader of the Celtics at just 23 years old. He perfectly balances personal aggression with team-first selflessness. Such balance was on full display Tuesday night. Brown took over during the second quarter, when he scored 12 points all by himself. He also took a back seat when Tatum took over during the second half, when Tatum scored 26 total points. In the end, Brown understands that both avenues can and will lead to team success, just as they did Tuesday in Portland. That is the one and only result with which he is concerned. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys in this league that are super talented, but a lot of them don\u2019t know how to win or be leaders,\u201d Brown said Tuesday. \u201cSo, as I\u2019m learning, I think that\u2019s an important part of the game that people forget about.\u201d Tatum then commented that selflessness, like what Brown is displaying this season, has been a critical component to Boston\u2019s success. \u201cThat\u2019s the sign of a good team,\u201d he said of players celebrating others\u2019 success. \u201cWe all enjoy playing with each other. It\u2019s different guys every night. Everybody just wants to win. That\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d The Celtics, now winners of 13 of their last 16 games, are winning as often as anyone in the league right now. They sit third in the Eastern Conference standings, just 1.5 games behind the Toronto Raptors, and have already beaten every playoff team with the exception of Houston, Indiana and Utah, who they will play for the first time Wednesday night. There is no question about whether or not Tatum has been the star of this surge. He has. But even he made sure to point out Tuesday night that the Celtics wouldn\u2019t be experiencing this level of success without the presence of Brown\u2019s stellar play. \u201cWe\u2019ve both kinda taken leaps this year, and so it\u2019s been fun,\u201d Tatum said of he and Brown. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing great all season, and he\u2019s one of the biggest reasons why we\u2019ve been winning.\u201d Don\u2019t forget that \u2013 no matter how much Brown\u2019s selfless attitude might open the door to do so.

With 24.3 seconds remaining in overtime and Boston leading by one point, Daniel Theis fouled Harden in transition and sent the superstar to the line for two free throws. Harden had struggled mightily throughout the contest to that point, making just seven of his 24 field goal attempts while getting to the free-throw line for only one attempt. But in this moment, he had ice in his veins. Harden stepped to the line and calmly sank both attempts to put Houston ahead 111-110 entering the final 24 seconds of the game. Boston chose not to call its final timeout, instead opting to allow its players attempt a potential game-winning shot against a defense that was not set. It took the Celtics nearly 21 seconds at the other end of the court to get a shot off. Gordon Hayward was the first member of the team to make a move with the ball, as he drove toward the left wing and dropped a dribble-hand-off to Jaylen Brown, who was lifting up from the left corner. Daniel Theis then set a screen for Brown, and after Houston switched, leaving Robert Covington on Brown, Brown turned the corner and drove into the paint. Covington is known as an elite defender and he was exactly that on this play. He was right on Brown\u2019s left hip as the two players entered the paint, and so Brown needed a couple of nifty moves to create space for a shot. After one crossover between the legs and two step-backs, Brown finally freed himself up for a potential game-winner from the free-throw line with about four seconds left on the clock. The shot had a beautiful arc to it, but it fell just short off the front of the rim. Theis grabbed the offensive rebound, but by the time he gained control, the clock had hit double zeroes and the final horn sounded. A make would have given Brown one of the most impressive clutch performances in recent memory for the Celtics. Minutes earlier, following an intentionally-missed free throw from Tatum, Brown had hit a miracle, buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the top of the arc to send the game into overtime. It would have been a perfect ending had he hit the game-winner in OT as well. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not what the basketball gods wanted on this day. His final attempt came up short, allowing the Rockets to escape with a victory under the slimmest of margins. Marcus Smart was outstanding from start to finish Saturday night. Without him, Boston would not have had a chance to take down James Harden, Russell Westbrook and the Houston Rockets. Smart stuffed the stat sheet with 26 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a game-high four steals during his nearly 45 minutes of action. He was one of only four Celtics who finished with a positive plus/minus rating, as Boston outscored Houston by two points while he was on the court. The funny thing is that while Smart was so great statistically, he was just as good in the doesn\u2019t-show-up-in-the-box-score plays. Smart, after all, was the player who tipped the ball out to Jaylen Brown for the game-tying, buzzer-beating 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime following Jayson Tatum\u2019s intentionally-missed free throw. That was just one of many plays that Smart made that helped his team in a big way but won\u2019t show up in his box score. Brad Stevens on the Houston Rockets "}

Boston tonight will face off against the Portland Trail Blazers, whose defense is anchored by the NBA\u2019s leading shot blocker, Hassan Whiteside. Whiteside is averaging 3.1 blocks per game this season, which leads the league by a wide margin ahead of second-ranked Brook Lopez (2.5 BPG). Tonight\u2019s challenge comes two days after the Celtics faced Anthony Davis, who ranks third in the league in shot blocks per game, and one day before they\u2019ll face Rudy Gobert, who ranks seventh in the league and is the reigning back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year. The Celtics acknowledged at Tuesday morning\u2019s shootaround that the presence of those great shot blockers affects their approach at the rim. \u201cYou can\u2019t run in there, jump off one foot and hope,\u201d said Brad Stevens, \u201cbecause you\u2019ll get that thing swatted away.\u201d Kemba Walker, who will miss his third straight game tonight with a sore left knee but who is known for attacking the rim, said that his teammates must be aware of their surroundings when they drive into the paint against Whiteside. \u201cWhen you go to the basket you have to know that he wants to come from the weak side and help his teammates and try to block your shots,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo a lot of the time, his man is open, or another guy is open because he\u2019s coming and they have to rotate. So you\u2019ve got to be conscious of basically getting into the paint and looking for your teammates.\u201d Walker also added that the C\u2019s cannot allow themselves to be afraid to go at Whiteside tonight. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to attack him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have to.\u201d That being said, Boston must also make quality decisions when it gets to the rim, a notion to which Stevens and Walker both alluded. They cannot afford to force shots, because that could cause them damage in more ways than one. \u201cThe blocked shot is a problem for two reasons,\u201d Stevens explained. \u201cNo. 1 is you don\u2019t score, but No. 2 is it starts the (fast) break (for the opponent). So we need to be great about making the right decisions at the rim.\u201d The Celtics were sound in their decision making Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles while facing Davis and the Lakers. Boston scored 44 points in the paint during that game while allowing Los Angeles to block only four shots, two of which were by Davis. They also allowed the Lakers to score only 16 fast break points, which was nearly three below LA\u2019s season average. The players who will be tied closest to Boston's success in these areas are Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum. Their plan, and Boston's plan in general, is to duplicate their efforts from Sunday tonight against Whiteside, and again Wednesday night against Gobert. Doing so, however, is easier said than done. Every team enters matchups with these big men with similar game plans to the one Boston described Tuesday morning. Yet still, Whiteside leads the league in blocks, and Gobert is again a leading candidate for Defensive Player of the Year. This is unquestionably Boston\u2019s most challenging stretch of the season when it comes to playing against elite shot blockers and finishing at the rim. The Celtics were successful in combatting such challenges during Round 1 in Los Angeles. We\u2019ll find out tonight if they can do so again during Round 2 in Portland. "}

The thing is, Tatum was the best player who touched it. Tatum was a dominant force while matching his career high of 41 points during a 114-112 defeat to the Lakers in LA. He took over during the second and third quarters, scoring 36 combined points during those periods despite the long list of defenders and defensive tactics the Lakers threw at him. Tatum was so impressive that James, who scored 29 points himself, held a long embrace with Tatum after the game, and then publicly endorsed Tatum in his postgame comments and in an Instagram post. \u201cThe kid is special,\u201d James said after the contest. \u201cObviously that\u2019s a reason he\u2019s a first-time All-Star, and he\u2019s been special all year.\u201d Within a few hours of the game ending, James then took to Instagram to show the world the respect he has for Boston\u2019s budding superstar. \u201cThat boi to the left of me is an ABSOLUTE PROBLEM!!\u201d James wrote in his post. That boi to the left of me is an ABSOLUTE PROBLEM!! Keep going #YoungKing #OnelegSleeveGang lol A post shared by  LeBron James (@kingjames) on Feb 23, 2020 at 5:27pm PST Tatum posted the same photo shortly thereafter, along with the caption, \u201cMoments you live for! Just a kid from St. Louis.\u201d Tatum chose not to reveal what James said to him during their postgame embrace on the court, which lasted 13 seconds, when he was asked about it in the locker room. Most likely, the message from James involved encouragement to keep working, as well as confirmation that Tatum can become one of the best players in the world. After all, he\u2019s already trending in that direction at the ripe age of 21 years old. Tatum has averaged 27.6 points per game since Jan. 11, a stretch that includes two 41-point efforts, five games of at least 30 points, and 10 games of at least 25 points. That average ranks eighth in the NBA over the last six weeks. His scorching-hot stretch culminated \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 Sunday with a performance that opened eyes across the country and led to ESPN color commentator Mark Jackson saying simply of Tatum, \u201cHe\u2019s got it.\u201d Tatum\u2019s teammates agree. \u201cTatum has reached a new height, man,\u201d Jaylen Brown said Sunday. \u201cSuperstar level.\u201d Added Gordon Hayward, \u201cCertainly, I think he has taken it to another level.\u201d The Lakers found that the only way to get Tatum off of that level Sunday afternoon was by throwing something at him that he had never seen before. Beginning late in the third quarter, and extending through the entire fourth quarter while Tatum was in the game, Los Angeles sent double-teams and traps at the talented wing every time he touched the ball. Asked after the game if he had ever seen that many double-teams, Tatum replied simply, \u201cNo, that was the first time.\u201d Which is why it worked. Tatum accounted for only four points on 1-for-3 shooting during the final period, although his two misses were on simple layup attempts that he still managed to create, but was unable to finish. He was mostly turned into a passer for his seven-plus minutes of action during the final frame as the Lakers did everything they could to make other Celtics beat them. Hayward, who along with Kemba Walker are the only members of Boston\u2019s team who have substantial experience facing double-teams and traps, spoke about the challenge of facing such defensive tactics for the first time. He noted that the adjustment does not fall solely on the shoulders of the star player who\u2019s being targeted. \u201cCertainly, it\u2019s another level when it starts happening to you,\u201d he said of the double-teams. \u201cI think it\u2019s not just on the person who\u2019s being doubled; you\u2019ve got to have an outlet, you\u2019ve got to have guys in the right spots. We\u2019re going to have to be \u2013 all of us are going to have to be better.\u201d Boston still managed to score 25 points on 52.9 percent shooting during the fourth quarte. Still, the C\u2019s know they can get even better against double-teaming defenses. Tatum knows he can get even better against double-teaming defenses. Once the third-year wing learns how to attack such schemes, the game will open up even more for the rest of the talented Celtics who are on the court with him. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take the ball out of someone\u2019s hands, so they\u2019re leaving somebody open,\u201d Hayward said of the strategy. \u201cWe have a lot of weapons, so we should take advantage of that.\u201d The Celtics will in due time. This was, as Tatum confirmed, the first time he has faced such a defense, and the first time Boston has faced it with Tatum as the target. He will learn, he will adjust, and he will get better. That\u2019s a scary notion. Tatum has already ascended into a new stratosphere \u2013 one of which few NBA players occupy. He has played like a superstar for the past six weeks and on Sunday outperformed James and Davis, two of arguably the top five basketball players in the world. Tatum has become an absolute problem for opponents. James said it himself. "}

The game's most pivotal moment, however, glanced right off of Boston's fingertips, leading to a narrow defeat. Boston had a 110-108 lead with just under 40 seconds remaining, when Jaylen Brown committed a shooting foul on LeBron James. The LA superstar sunk his first attempt and then missed the second. However, the rebound glanced off the fingertips of both Brown and Anthony Davis and went out of bounds. The replay appeared indecisive as to whose finger the ball touched last, but it was ultimately ruled Lakers ball. James then took advantage of LA\u2019s second chance, as he knocked down a 15-foot jumper to give the Lakers a one-point lead with 30 seconds remaining. During Boston\u2019s ensuing trip up the court, Brown tried to lead Jayson Tatum with a short lob pass just above the left break, but Tatum collided with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope as he tried to gain possession and it went out of bounds. Brad Stevens was called for a technical foul as he disputed the call \u2013 or lack of call \u2013 against Caldwell-Pope, though Davis wound up missing the technical free throw anyway. Davis was then fouled on the inbound pass, which sent him to the free-throw line where he would sink both shots to put the Lakers up 113-110 with 12.3 seconds left. In order to avoid a game-tying situation, the Lakers intentionally fouled Grant Williams off of Boston\u2019s inbound pass. The rookie knocked down both freebies, bringing the C\u2019s back within one. Davis was then fouled again, but this time sunk just 1-of-2 from the stripe, which gave Boston a chance to tie or win on its final possession. Tatum, however, was whistled for an offensive foul just before rising up for the potential game-winning triple, thus securing a 114-112 Lakers win. Jayson Tatum turned in anouther career outing Sunday afternoon, this time while facing off against the best team in the West and two of the top players on the planet. The 21-year-old wing tied his career-high in scoring with 41 points, as he outperformed both Anthony Davis and LeBron James in that category. After tallying just one point during the first quarter, Tatum turned it on in the second by putting up 18 points over a 12-minute span. He then dropped another 18 during the third quarter, which gave him 37 points entering the final frame. Tatum also set a new career high at the free-throw line, where he sunk 13 of his 15 attempts. On top of that, he coralled five rebounds, dished out two steals, blocked two shots and snagged one steal during his 37 minutes of action. Jaylen Brown on the loss. "}

The victory over the Pistons also marked forward Carmelo Anthony's best game with the Trail Blazers, as he scored a season-high 32 points and matched his season best of five 3-pointers. \"He's really good at pick-and-rolls, he sets great screens and he has that offensive repertoire where he shoots the mid-range and gets to isolation, so I was glad to see him wide open, especially down the stretch,\" McCollum said of Anthony in a postgame interview with NBCS Northwest. \"That's what he's done for 16 years -- he hits big shots.\" McCollum equaled his season best of six 3-pointers and also collected nine rebounds. His all-around big performance helped the Trail Blazers snap a three-game losing streak as they try to chase down the eighth-place Memphis Grizzlies for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. \"We understood the importance of this win with our hopes of making the playoffs,\" McCollum said. \"We need every game, especially at home and (Detroit) is under .500, so we just dug deep.\" The competition level will be tougher with the Celtics in town. Boston had won 12 of 14 games before losing 114-112 to the host Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in an epic battle. LeBron James hit the decisive shot with 30.4 seconds left as the Celtics fell to 1-1 on a four-game road trip. \"That's a great atmosphere,\" Boston shooting guard Jaylen Brown, who scored 20 points, told reporters. \"It don't get too much better than that. To be honest, I had a great time. Even though we lost, it was fun being out there competing at the highest level, and it makes you thirsty for the postseason.\" Tatum was superb while matching his career high of 41 points. He is averaging 36 points over the past three games while continuing to increase his star status. Brown noted that it was time to move up the 21-year-old All-Star to a new level. \"Tatum has reached a new height -- superstar level,\" Brown said. \"We've all got to continue to improve and go with him. The way he's playing is unreal. We've got to continue to find ways to allow him to reach his potential.\" The Celtics missed All-Star point guard Kemba Walker (knee) for the second straight game. Still, Tatum didn't want to hear about who wasn't on the floor. \"We still should've won,\" Tatum told reporters. \"We know that. We can't make excuses when guys are out. That was definitely a game we should've won. ... That's all that really matters. I know what I'm capable of. My teammates know that. We know what each and every guy can do in here.\" Tatum has scored 20 or more points in 14 of the past 16 games. He is averaging 22.9 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers allowed an average of 93 points while winning both of last season's meetings against the Celtics. "}

Boston and Los Angeles have 33 NBA championships between them and have met in the Finals a record 12 times. Both are once again title contenders, with the Celtics sitting third in the Eastern Conference and the Lakers leading the Western Conference. Los Angeles returned from the All-Star break Friday and defeated eighth-place Memphis, 117-105, in a potential preview of a first-round playoff matchup. The Lakers limited the Grizzlies to 41 first-half points and forced 16 turnovers. \"We understand every team we're going to play, they're going to play great against us. They look forward to that matchup,\" Lakers star LeBron James told reporters after the win. \"It's up to us to take them out of what they do well. That's what happened. Avery (Bradley) and JaVale (McGee) and Anthony (Davis) and the rest of us really being sound defensively and in tune with the game plan worked out well for us.\" Bradley tallied 14 points and three steals and Davis blocked seven shots to go with his 28 points and 13 rebounds. Los Angeles needs to replicate that defensive intensity to reverse course from its previous meeting with Boston this season. The host Celtics crushed the Lakers 139-107 on Jan. 20, with Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown all scoring 20-plus points. Boston comes to L.A. off of an even more balanced offensive showing. Four Celtics -- Brown, Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Daniel Theis -- each scored at least 25 points in a 127-117 win Friday at Minnesota. It marked the first time since 1960 that four Boston players hit that mark in the same game. \"It's a long time,\" Theis said of the historic milestone 60 years in the making. \"It just shows how deep and how good our team is. We have guys who can score 20 (points) every night.\" The accomplishment is perhaps made all the more impressive considering that Walker -- one of three Celtics averaging more than 20 points per game on the season -- missed Friday's game after having his knee drained. The Boston Globe reported that the four-time All-Star could miss one to two weeks. Walker has played a key role in Boston's offense with 21.8 points and 5.0 assists per game. He scored 20 points and dished seven assists in last month's meeting with the Lakers, and was one of seven Celtics to record at least one steal. Defensive energy proved as vital to that win as Boston's offensive balance. The Celtics held the Lakers to 43.8 percent shooting from the floor, 26.9 percent from 3-point range, and forced 15 turnovers. Boston also limited James to 15 points, more than 10 below his season average, and held Davis to nine points, almost 18 fewer than his season average. The Celtics rank third in the NBA in points allowed, holding opponents to 106.4 points per game. The Lakers are not far behind, however, with their trip to Boston serving as something of an aberration. Los Angeles is limiting opponents to 107.3 points per game, sixth best in the NBA. "}

While it\u2019s back to business today, with these players standing on opposite sides of the most historic rivalry in basketball, Vogel took time before tip-off to explain why he enjoyed the time he spent around Boston\u2019s budding star last weekend. \u201cGreat guy. Great guy,\u201d Vogel said of Tatum. \u201cHe\u2019s just a \u2013 he\u2019s got a refreshing personality and approach toward the game.\u201d Pressed to elaborate on what he meant by the term \u2018refreshing personality,\u2019 Vogel responded by saying, \u201cYou enjoy being around him. He\u2019s got that good smile. Just his personality\u2026 he\u2019s fun. He\u2019s engaging. He\u2019s intelligent. He was refreshing to be around.\u201d Vogel revealed that his comments in part stemmed from a conversation he had with Tatum heading into the All-Star game about expectations with regard to playing time. He basically told Tatum, who wound up playing less than 14 minutes in the game, that his minutes would he sparse. Yet Tatum took no exception to the news. \u201cHe was really good about whatever minutes I wanted to play him. He was fine with that,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHe was just excited to be there. The Celtics are lucky to have him.\u201d Certainly, that\u2019s true, as Tatum is Boston\u2019s leading scorer at the ripe age of just 21 years old. He is already an All-Star, and is well on his way to becoming a superstar. What some may not realize is that Tatum\u2019s personality, which Vogel described as refreshing, is playing a significant role in Tatum\u2019s high level of success. After saying that Tatum is \u201cvery quiet\u201d with a \u201csheepish sarcasm to him,\u201d Celtics head coach Brad Stevens dove into the impact that Tatum\u2019s reserved personality makes on his game. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great emotional intelligence, as I\u2019ve said many times,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe can operate in any environment. And when things get crazy out on the court, he has a great way about him and a very calm way about him.\u201d Such emotional intelligence has been on full display throughout Tatum\u2019s young career, including in the very building he will play in this afternoon \u2013 the STAPLES Center. Tatum hit one of the most clutch shots of his career back on Nov. 20 against the Clippers, when he shook free from Paul George and drained a 3-pointer during the final seconds to send a thrilling game to overtime. There\u2019s a chance he could make similar noise today, while he takes on James, Davis and Vogel, who were very briefly his teammates last weekend in Chicago. - Marc D'Amico "}

The fifth continues to fly under the radar while continuing to produce. Daniel Theis, the least-heralded starter on the Celtics, added another strong performance to his impressive season Friday night when he piled up new career highs of 25 points and 16 rebounds during a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. These nights are rare for Theis, who averages just 8.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game this season, but they lead to the center receiving the credit he has deserved all along for being a critical piece to Boston\u2019s success. Without him, the Celtics are not who they\u2019ve become, which is true title contenders. Theis is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces on this team, despite his average numbers. He contributes in ways that don\u2019t always show up in the box score, which is exactly what his role on this team calls for. Brad Stevens has asked Theis to be a defensive anchor who doubles as a super-glue guy surrounding four star players in Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward. Theis has excelled in that role, as Stevens alluded to Friday night by saying, \u201cI think the way that he plays just fits the other guys perfect.\u201d And it\u2019s not only Stevens who feels this way. The rest of the starters do too, because they know that Theis is reliable, he is consistent, and he doesn\u2019t care about any statistic other than the win column. \u201cHe\u2019s really unselfish \u2026 I mean, that\u2019s who he is,\u201d said Gordon Hayward, who teamed with Theis many times Friday night in the pick-and-roll game. \u201cHe wants to win and he makes all of us better, and that\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t always show up in the stat sheet and you have to really watch the game to understand the kind of impact he\u2019s able to have on games.\u201d Theis has completely bought into his role, which most commonly leads to him flying under the radar. But there are nights like Friday, when the game opens up for him and he\u2019s able to log gaudy numbers. Boston ran a heavy dose of pick-and-roll against a Timberwolves team that opted to play a lot of small ball Friday night. Theis took advantage by finding the seams in Minnesota\u2019s defense, which led to him making eight buckets from inside the restricted area. \u201cYou know, he got a great feel for the game, so he really knows kind of where to be at different points in time, whether that\u2019s rolling to rim, half-rolling, popping out,\u201d Hayward described. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good basketball player, and that\u2019s just on that end.\u201d Theis is also a great defender who provides the Celtics with versatility. He can guard any position, which is an ability the Celtics took advantage of Friday night against a skilled Timberwolves team. \u201cHis defense is just really, really good,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cYou saw we had him at the top of the key quite a bit there on different alignments. He can guard guards and he can protect the rim.\u201d With all of this praise coming Theis\u2019 way, it would have been easy for it to go straight to his head. Instead, the big man chose to joke about his big scoring night. \u201cWe have guys that can score 20 every night with Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward,\u201d he said, \u201cand today I was even in the mix.\u201d After a quick laugh, Theis got right back to being the guy everyone in Boston has come to know: the unselfish one who spends little time worrying about his stats, and most of his time buying into his role on this team. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone knows I don\u2019t care about the scoring. I care about the defensive parts.\u201d That unselfish mindset is why Theis has flown under the national radar all season long. Every once in a while, though, a night like Friday will happen, when Theis puts forth a performance that\u2019s impossible to ignore. This night is all about giving Theis the credit he has deserves all season long. In the words of his coach, he has been the perfect complement to Boston\u2019s star-studded starting lineup. "}

After winning the competition at All-Star weekend last year in Charlotte, Tatum fell during the opening round of this year\u2019s tournament to Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis. \u201cThat was quick,\u201d a smiling Tatum joked after the end of the competition. The challenge, which features two players going head-to-head in a heat through an obstacle course that tests each players\u2019 dribbling, passing and shooting skills, ends with one of the players making a 3-pointer. Tatum and Sabonis reached the 3-point line for their attempts at the exact same time, but Sabonis made one first. Sabonis missed his first attempt badly while Tatum waited for him to misfire. Tatum\u2019s first attempt then missed short off the front of the rim, and Sabonis followed up with his second attempt that fell through the net for the win. Tatum said afterward that his loss came down to two things: how he handled his 3-point shooting, and how he prepared \u2013 or didn\u2019t prepare \u2013 for the event. \u201cI shoulda shot the second 3 quicker,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he was gonna miss, but he made it.\u201d He also added in some context about his lack of practice time. \u201cI didn\u2019t get no practice in before. I shoulda practiced,\u201d he said. \u201cThey let you practice like 30 minutes before they open the doors or something. I got busy taking pictures and other stuff.\u201d Well, that sorta thing will happen when you become a real All-Star and take over the final game of the NBA schedule before the All-Star break, which Tatum did Thursday night against the LA Clippers. Despite the loss, Tatum was all smiles after the event, which was won by Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo. Tatum said he was surprised by all of the big men in the event making their first pass attempt into the small, circular net that that is in the middle of the obstacle course. \u201cAll the bigs made it on the first try,\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t get that \u2026 They had to practice that. I think they practiced.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, it didn\u2019t sound like Sabonis was very excited when he found out on live television that he would be facing off against the talented defending champion in the first round of the bracket. Sabonis told Celtics.com of the draw, \u201cI was like, \u2018Of course, I gotta go against Tatum! I couldn\u2019t go against a big or something?\u2019\u201d Sabonis wound up advancing to the championship round of the bracket before losing to Adebayo. Tatum said that this may be the final time he partakes in the Skills Challenge, saying, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take some years off from the Skills Competition.\u201d He did, however, leave the door open for another competition: the 3-point shootout. \u201cI wanna do that one day,\u201d he said quickly after being asked of his interest in the event. As for the dunk contest? He shot that one down with authority. \u201cI ain\u2019t got no special dunks,\u201d he joked. \u201cI just do regular dunks in the game\u2026 sometimes I dunk on people.\u201d He\u2019s got a shot to do so tomorrow night in the big game. A year ago, Tatum was heading out of town after winning the Skills Challenge title. This year, he gets to stick around and play in the premier event of the weekend as an All-Star for the very first time. "}

{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/post-ups-20200221", "article": " MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 The Boston Celtics are on high alert when it comes to the impact of Minnesota\u2019s roster overhaul at the trade deadline. The Timberwolves acquired nine new players around the trade deadline, seven of whom were introduced as new members of the team Feb. 7 at a press conference. D\u2019Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley are the team\u2019s most important acquisitions, as they now make up 40 percent of Minnesota\u2019s starting lineup. The overhaul has allowed the Timberwolves to play a new brand of high-speed basketball while also allowing its new players to step into roles they have sought out for quite some time. \u201cThey\u2019re playing super free,\u201d said Brad Stevens. \u201cThey\u2019re playing super spaced.\u201d One of the players who is producing much of that space is sharpshooter Beasley, who was acquired from the Denver Nuggets. Beasley has stepped into a starting role with the Timberwolves that has led to an average of 32.7 minutes per game and 11.0 3-point attempts per game with Minnesota. By contract, he averaged only 18.2 minutes and 3.9 attempts from long distance in Denver. With his new team, Beasley is viewed as a critical piece of the future, rather than just an end-of-rotation body. That\u2019s a game-changing revelation for a young player like Beasley, who is only 23 years old. As Stevens said before tonight\u2019s tip-off, \u201cBeasley has a new lease on life.\u201d Stevens went on to comment on the fear of playing against teams that have made major changes, and players who are able to step into new and upgraded roles. \u201cIt\u2019s always scary to play teams after the trade deadline,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a lot of guys that have new roles that they\u2019re enthusiastic about, and rightfully so.\u201d Stevens said the best example that comes to mind of an opponent\u2019s resurgence arrived two years ago, on an important mid-February night in Celtics history in 2018. \u201cI go back to the day we retired Paul Pierce\u2019s jersey, and Cleveland had those big trades and they came in and drubbed us,\u201d Stevens recalled. \u201cThey beat us by [22]. \u201cI just think that you get the trade bump. It\u2019s kind of a freshness, guys are excited to play, they get new roles and they get to do things that they wanted to do at their previous spot and they\u2019re anxious to do that.\u201d Stevens said that the Celtics have at times been on the right side of that scenario, as they\u2019ve acquired players around the deadline who have come in and sparked the team with strong play. He also admitted that the team has been on the wrong side of that scenario, like during that matchup with Cleveland two years ago, when a rejuvenated opponent took it to the C\u2019s with its upgraded roster. Boston is on alert to avoid such a situation tonight. It is not interested in allowing this overhauled Timberwolves team to deal the Celtics a loss during their first game of a four-game road trip. - Marc D'Amico "}

One of the league's hottest teams entering the All-Star break with eight wins in their last nine games, the Celtics open a four-game trip that features a showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers in a nationally televised affair on Sunday. Boston will also visit Portland and Utah on the six-day venture, which begins a stretch in which the Atlantic Division contender will play 12 of 18 on the road. The Celtics will face Minnesota without All-Star point guard Kemba Walker, who is dealing with left knee soreness. Walker, a four-time All-Star, is averaging 21.8 points and 5.0 assists this season. Boston has been far better at home (23-5) than away (15-11) this season, but has begun to turn things around on the road with three wins in the last four outings. The Celtics have not faced Minnesota yet this season. That being the case, it's possible the Celtics could go the entire season without having to deal with Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns, who missed Minnesota's final game before the break last Wednesday with a sprained left wrist. He remains out indefinitely. The Celtics and Timberwolves meet for a second and final time on March 29 in Boston. Towns had been on a nice roll before suffering the injury, having recorded five consecutive double-doubles in which he averaged 24.0 points, 11.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists. Without Towns, the Timberwolves started four relative strangers in their 115-108 home loss to Charlotte last Wednesday. Malik Beasley and Juan Hernangomez, both acquired from Denver in a four-team trade that saw the Timberwolves send Robert Covington to Houston, combined for 44 points and 18 rebounds against the Hornets, while D'Angelo Russell, picked up from Golden State at the expense of Andrew Wiggins, went for 26 points and 11 assists. James Johnson, acquired from Miami in a three-team swap in which the Timberwolves delivered Gorgui Dieng to Memphis, was a fourth newcomer in the starting lineup against Charlotte. He chipped in with five points, five rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks. Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders noted earlier this week that Johnson will be a focal point of the offense with Towns out of action. \"In a way it will allow us to install more of our kind of free-flowing game with guards, with wings, with James handling the ball,\" he told reporters. \"We know we're thin on the front line right now. We're going to have to be creative.\" For the time being, most of that creativity will have to come on the road. After hosting the Celtics, Minnesota will play 11 of 15 away from home. In the Celtics, the new-look Timberwolves will see a group that's become well acquainted with one another. \"We've got what a lot of teams don't have: We have five core players who have been playing two or more years together in a system that they're familiar with,\" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said of a group that also includes Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Walker. \"They're all unique and versatile in their position where they can play multiple positions, and you don't find that very often.\" Brown, who missed Boston's most recent game last Thursday against the Los Angeles Clippers with a sore calf, is expected to face the Timberwolves.

Walker developed swelling in his left knee upon his return to Boston following the All-Star break. The swelling was treated with two different types of procedures, according to head coach Brad Stevens. \u201cObviously he didn\u2019t [practice] Wednesday, and then we decided to - what is it? \u2013 drain the swelling,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd then he got an injection of Synvisc, which is a pretty common thing when guys are dealing with swelling and knee soreness.\u201d Stevens then explained how Walker\u2019s current knee situation varies from what he experienced at the start of February, which caused the All-Star point guard to miss three games due to knee soreness. \u201cThe difference between how his knee presented on Wednesday (and) how it presented throughout his period of soreness that we had sat him with, was he just had a lot more swelling,\u201d the coach stated. \u201cObviously, that was an indicator that we needed to check it. He had another scan. Knee looks good structurally. But he\u2019s going to be managing it and dealing with it, as he has all year.\u201d The Celtics do not know when Walker will return to their lineup. However, after saying that the injury \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s long-term,\u201d Stevens did not rule out a return for Walker as early as Sunday in LA. \u201cI don\u2019t know what our plan of attack is after today. I haven\u2019t even asked,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s short-term enough that that will be in the discussion. \u201cAnd we also have to just decide, kinda like we did in the period before the All-Star break: does he benefit from strengthening for a week without games? Does he benefit from strengthening for two weeks without games? I don\u2019t know what the answer to that is. That\u2019s where he and the medical staff have to put their heads together and come up with a plan, and we\u2019ll follow it.\u201d Speaking of the medical staff, Stevens went out of his way to defend the group\u2019s plan for Walker prior the All-Star break, as well as allowing him to play in the All-Star game itself. Walker missed three games before returning to play the final four leading into the break, including one game during which Walker played more than 45 minutes. He also played major minutes during a competitive All-Star contest. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important (to state): there\u2019s no way he would have played or our medical staff would have played (him) if they thought that this was going to be possible after the break,\u201d he said. Stevens then commented on those 45-plus minutes Walker logged during a double-overtime win over the LA Clippers right before the All-Star break. \u201cSo, what they (the medical staff) said was that, they said he could have one big one,\u201d Stevens revealed of the conversation around Walker\u2019s playing time leading into the break. \u201cObviously that was as big one. There\u2019s no question about it. Then he felt good enough after that, and we were fortunate with that.\u201d The C\u2019s aren\u2019t quite as fortunate now, but they are hopeful that Walker\u2019s knee will respond well to treatment and that he\u2019ll be back in the lineup soon. As of Friday, \u2018soon\u2019 could mean as early as Sunday, or it could mean two weeks from now. Boston should have a much clearer picture of Walker\u2019s future availability once Walker is evaluated this weekend in Los Angeles. "}

Up by just three points with only four and a half minutes to play, they scored seven straight to build a double-digit lead with 2:16 left in the game. That lead was more than enough to carry them to their 12th win in their last 14 games. The run opened with a layup from Daniel Theis off a pass from Gordon Hayward. Hayward and Theis had been taking it to Minnesota all night with the pick-and-roll, and they did so again on this play. Just 27 seconds later, after D\u2019Angelo Russell missed a shot for the Timberwolves, Marcus Smart found Jayson Tatum in transition for a 3-pointer from the right wing. Somehow, Minnesota had lost Boston\u2019s leading scorer in transition and Tatum was left for a wide-open attempt \u2013 one he surely wasn\u2019t going to miss. Theis then capped the run at the 2:16 mark with a dunk that came off of yet another pass from Hayward. Theis rose up to catch the pass on a roll to the rim, hauled it in, then went up to throw down the slam that gave Boston a 121-111 lead. The Celtics led by at least eight for the remainder of the game before closing out a 127-117 victory. That 7-0 run is what gave them the juice they needed to hold off a pesky Timberwolves team that had hung around all night. The beauty of the Celtics is that on any night, one of their stars can take over. Friday night in Minneapolis, it was Gordon Hayward\u2019s turn. Hayward scored a game-high 29 points against the Timberwolves thanks to a super-efficient 12-for-17 shooting night. He made 10 of his 15 2-pointers, two of his four 3-pointers and three of his five free throws to account for his 29 points. As per usual with Hayward, he also filled the box score in other areas. The talented wing dished out six assists to finish second on the team in that category, he hauled in five rebounds and he grabbed two steals at the defensive end. Hayward is now shooting 51.1 percent from the field, 39.5 percent from 3-point range and 86.6 percent from the free-throw line this season. He\u2019s just the latest star to take over a game for Boston and lead the C\u2019s to a win. Gordon Hayward on the Celtics "}

After being sidelined for nearly two and a half months with a bone edema in his left hip, the second-year big man was finally cleared to rejoin his teammates for their first post-All-Star practice session at Auerbach Center. \u201cThe last time I played was Dec. 6,\u201d a smiling Williams told reporters after practice. \u201cSo it's nice being out there with the guys.\u201d The guys enjoyed having him back, as well. \u201cHe looked good today,\u201d said Jaylen Brown. \u201cHe had a lot of high energy and was making ridiculous plays. The important thing is to keep him healthy and keep him consistent these last 20-something games and add him to the rotation.\u201d The Celtics are hoping that they\u2019ll be able to add him back into the rotation around March 1. In the meantime, he\u2019ll travel with the team on their upcoming four-game trip out west, and he\u2019ll continue to ramp up his on-court activity as time goes on. Coach Brad Stevens elaborated further: \u201cHe'll practice and work out through the rest of the next week or so and then go back for a final scan to make sure that he hadn\u2019t had any negative response to all this extra load. And then from that point on, he'll either be cleared or he won't. So it\u2019s all dependent on how his body reacts to the last six weeks (of rehab), and then really ramping it up this week.\" Williams admits that it\u2019s difficult not to ramp things up to 100 percent out of the gate now that he\u2019s been \u201clet free.\u201d But he\u2019s also being smart about his approach as he looks at the bigger picture. \u201cThere's no limitations on anything I'm doing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI want to windmill every time I dunk. But I've still got to be cautious a little bit, you know what I'm saying?\u201d As soon as he\u2019s able to push himself up to 100 percent, Williams will be ready to return. Having him back should greatly enhance the Celtics\u2019 frontcourt depth, especially considering that both Enes Kanter and Daniel Theis have been dealing with nagging injuries of their own. Prior to his injury, Williams had found himself a solid role in Boston\u2019s rotation. During his 19 appearances, he saw an average of 14.2 minutes of playing time and tallied 3.9 points on 67.3 percent shooting, 4.6 rebounds 1.1 assists, 1.1 blocks and 0.9 steals per game. His most promising outing was an 11-point, seven-rebound, two-assist, six-block effort Nov. 9 during a blowout win in San Antonio. Williams is hoping to produce more performances like that down the final stretch of the regular season, but more than anything, he hopes to provide the Celtics with a spark on the defensive end. He claims to have spent a lot of time over the last six weeks working on his timing when it comes to going for steals and blocks, and he hopes that his hard work will translate when he returns to the court. \u201cI'm getting anxious, knowing I'm just a couple days away,\u201d Williams said in anticipation. \u201cSo I'm just staying locked in on this road trip, and we'll all wait for my comeback.\u201d "}

Sunday\u2019s showcase featured a walk-off free throw from Anthony Davis that gave Team LeBron a 157-155 win over Team Giannis in front of a sellout crowd that was on its feet for the majority of the untimed final quarter. This fourth quarter felt much like an NBA playoff game with regard to its competitiveness. Each team fought tooth-and-nail to reach the target score first. Charges were drawn. Fouls were furiously argued. Calls were challenged by both teams\u2019 coaches. In the end, it was a free throw from Davis that ended the most competitive and entertaining All-Star game ever played \u2013 one of which Bryant surely would have been proud. \u201cWe definitely felt his presence,\u201d Kemba Walker, a member of Team Giannis, said of Bryant. \u201cGrowing up, watching Kobe in those games, I felt like he was always competitive, and he was kind of the one who got the game going. I think we kept that going tonight. I think he definitely would have loved to watch the way we went out there and competed tonight.\u201d  Walker, Boston\u2019s point guard who was appearing in his fourth All-Star game, was right in the middle of the competition. He played the entirety of the final period despite doctor\u2019s orders, as he revealed after the contest. Walker told reporters that he entered the game with a minute restriction, but couldn\u2019t abide by it once he experienced the competitive nature of the fourth quarter. \u201cI was actually supposed to be on a minute restriction, but the game got too close,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI wanted to be out there. I wanted to compete. I knew down the stretch that it would get serious like that, and I wanted to be a part of it.\u201d Walker was a couple made shots away from potentially earning the game\u2019s MVP award, which this weekend was named after Bryant. He tied LeBron James and Chris Paul for the third-highest scoring total in the game with 23 points, which trailed only MVP winner Kawhi Leonard\u2019s 30 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s 25 points. Walker\u2019s 23 points blew away his previous high scoring effort in an All-Star game, as he did not score more than 11 during any of his first three appearances in the contest. He spoke after the game about how it felt to play at a high level on the world\u2019s brightest basketball stage. \u201cIt's always a blessing and an honor to get here,\u201d he said. \u201cI've come a long way in my career. This is my fourth All-Star. I'm blessed, and it's always an exciting time to get a chance to be a part of this.\u201d Walker\u2019s teammate in Boston, 21-year-old Jayson Tatum, was also blessed to be a part of the action for the first time in his career. He didn\u2019t quite have the same level of success as Walker, but that didn\u2019t sour the taste in his mouth. After logging six points, three assists, three steals and a rebound in 13-plus minutes of action for Team LeBron, Tatum was all smiles while recounting his night on the court and on the sidelines. \u201cIt\u2019s different, especially my first one,\u201d he said with a wide smile. \u201cI\u2019ve played against all those guys, sometimes in the Playoffs, and now we\u2019re laughing and joking together on the bench. It was fun.\u201d The highlight of the night from a Celtics perspective was when Tatum and Walker shared the court for a couple of minutes at the start of the second quarter. Walker got out to the advantage in the matchup, as he grabbed Tatum\u2019s quarter-opening miss and went coast-to-coast for a layup. Shortly thereafter, Tatum tried to answer when he and Walker were matched up in transition in a one-on-one situation. Tatum caught the ball on the right wing and immediately began to wave his teammates off so that he could go at Walker. He turned to post Walker up all the way out beyond the 3-point line and eventually backed his way down to the paint. Tatum then turned over his left shoulder toward the baseline and fired up a fadeaway jumper that missed off the front of the rim. \u201cI locked him up, like I told him,\u201d Walker joked after the game. It\u2019s Tatum who got the last laugh in this one, however. He was a member of the winning team, while Walker\u2019s 23 points were futile. Tatum was blunt after the game while commenting on the bragging rights between he and Walker. He said simply, \u201cWe won. He lost.\u201d Regardless of the outcome, there is no doubt that both Walker and Tatum enjoyed every minute of Sunday night. They were a part of a collection of the greatest basketball talent in the world that played the most competitive contest in the history of the NBA All-Star game. It was a thrill to everyone who participated in it or watched it, and it was a perfect tribute to Bryant. "}

One day after Bryant was announced as a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum, Boston\u2019s two All-Star representatives, spent a significant portion of their media availability discussing the impact Bryant made on their lives. While Tatum\u2019s relationship with Bryant was more public in recent years, it was Walker who knew Bryant much longer. Walker turned the clock back to his high school days to discuss Bryant\u2019s influence on him. \u201cI was very blessed to meet Kobe at a very young age,\u201d Walker said during All-Star Media Day. \u201cMy high school team was a Kobe team. So yeah, he inspired me and many other kids from my community, my high school.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe thing that always stood out to me was his work ethic. It was impeccable. It was second to none. And I think that helped me as a kid, just wanting to try my best to work as hard as him and it definitely paid off.\u201d Tatum, who was visibly shaken in the days following Bryant\u2019s tragic death, mentioned a similar takeaway from the time he spent around the five-time champion. Tatum said of Bryant, \u201cThe first thing that comes to mind is just, \u2018How much does it mean to you to be great? How hard are you willing to work? How much are you willing to sacrifice to be as great as you want to be?\u2019\u201d Boston\u2019s two stars also spoke about memories and on-court tendencies that they took away from Bryant. Walker was asked what moment he remembers most about facing off against Bryant, and he replied with the following story. \u201cThere was one time we actually met at the captain\u2019s circle (before a game), and I was playing well at the time, and he told me, he just told me, \u2018Keep going,\u2019\u201d Walker recalled. \u201cI thought that was pretty special for me.\u201d Meanwhile, Tatum pointed toward the elements of his game that he pulled from Bryant\u2019s. \u201cThere were a lot of things that he did (that I try to do),\u201d Tatum said. \u201cFootwork-wise \u2013 footwork would probably be the thing that I most tried to emulate and pay attention to.\u201d Neither Walker nor Tatum seemed to have any trouble controlling their emotions while speaking about Bryant. Such was not the case in the days after Bryant\u2019s death, and it may not be the case Sunday night, when the league honors Bryant, his daughter Gigi, and the others who lost their lives in the tragic helicopter accident. Each team will wear jerseys that will honor Kobe\u2019s and Gigi\u2019s lives by numbers, and the rest of those who were lost in the accident will be honored with a patch. Former commissioner David Stern, who also died in January, will be honored with a band on each jersey. Separately, the NBA also announced Saturday night that the All-Star MVP award has now been named the Kobe Bryant MVP Award. Every member of Team LeBron will wear jersey No. 2, which was Gigi\u2019s number. Every member of Team Giannis will wear jersey No. 24, which was Kobe\u2019s number for the final 10 seasons of his career. Those jerseys will say a lot to those who see them, and they will mean a lot to those who wear them. Walker said it will be the one piece of memorabilia that he will take away from this weekend and treasure forever. \u201cI think our jerseys are very special this year, being that both teams are honoring Kobe and Gigi,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to cherish that jersey for a very long time.\u201d As he and every other player should. Bryant\u2019s death stunned the NBA community and led to many tears and heartbreak. Similar feelings are likely to be felt Sunday night, during what will likely be the most emotional All-Star game in NBA history. "}
{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/uncommon-threads/gravitating-toward-the-dj-booth", "article": "by Taylor Snow \u2022             Celtics.com BOSTON \u2013 About an hour after helping the Boston             Celtics gobble up the New Orleans Pelicans in a 35-point blowout win, Jaylen Brown, dressed in a warm, gray             flannel and a black Mighty Ducks baseball cap, exits TD Garden into the frigid air of a mid-January Boston             night. He\u2019s left basketball behind, and now he\u2019s got music on his mind. The 6-foot-7 wing receives a few surprised double-takes and nods of recognition from lingering fans as he             steps onto an escalator lined with Celtic-green LED lights, and then rides to the second floor of the Hub on             Causeway complex to duck inside the West End\u2019s newest night club, Big Night Live. As soon as he walks through the venue\u2019s double-doors, Brown is met by the wall-shaking bass coming from the             next room over where an opening-act deejay set is warming up hundreds of vibrant clubgoers. But rather than             step out onto the dance floor, Brown turns down a back hallway and keeps walking until he comes face-to-face             with the main act of the night \u2013 Shaquille O\u2019Neal. In this setting, however, the former Celtics center and man of many pseudonyms is not known as \u201cShaq,\u201d but             rather \u201cDJ Diesel.\u201d And he was about to tear through this building like a runaway train out of North             Station. \u201cWhat you about to play?\u201d Brown coolly asks after dapping up the NBA Hall-of-Famer. \u201cWhat\u2019s the playlist?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Shaq shrugs, elaborating moments later, \u201cI can\u2019t ever tell until I look at the crowd.\u201d \u201cSo, you just press the buttons, or you do the spinning too?\u201d Brown asks. \u201cYeah, I spin,\u201d the 7-foot-1 gentle giant responds, flicking his wrists out in front of his torso to mimic a             deejay scratching a vinyl. \u201cWell I\u2019m about to watch you,\u201d Brown says before letting his new friend get to work. \u201cI\u2019m a fly on the wall.\u201d One who, on this night, is ready and anxious to learn about the art of deejaying. What sets Brown apart from many of his NBA peers is his endless appetite for knowledge and his constant             desire to acquire it. A perfect example is how he spent his first professional paycheck shortly after             getting drafted in the summer of 2016. \u201cMost people get cars, most people buy just whatever,\u201d Brown tells Celtics.com, \u201cbut my first big purchase, I             can honestly say, was a mini grand piano.\u201d At the time, the 19-year-old\u2019s experience behind the keys was limited at best. Brown\u2019s family didn\u2019t have the             means to afford him lessons during his youth in Marietta, Georgia. But as a lifelong music lover, he had             always desired to tap into his musical potential. \u201cMusic is just naturally a part of me,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBefore I can remember what right or wrong was, music has             just been there. My mom listened to music when she was pregnant with me, and it\u2019s just always been around.\u201d As time went on, Brown\u2019s library of instruments expanded. He bought an 88-key keyboard, a guitar, a MiniNova             synthesizer, and a beat machine, which he would often pack up and take with him on road trips during his             rookie season. He would often fill the little free time he had by teaching himself how to play the             instruments and learning how to create his own beats on the touch-pad machine. Making music ultimately             became an outlet for him. \u201cIt just keeps you engaged in something outside of basketball,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWhen you go home, it keeps you             out of trouble.\u201d Jeff Newton/Champs Sports It also helped to create balance in Brown\u2019s life. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to break away from the             time-consuming grind of an NBA season, but he believes that it\u2019s beneficial for one\u2019s mental health to             pursue other hobbies outside of the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have something to kind of reset yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cBasketball is definitely number             one for me, but having things outside of basketball that I\u2019m interested in \u2013 music, fashion, education \u2013             allows me to still keep that love for the game. Sometimes when it\u2019s all basketball, people get stressed or             annoyed or sometimes they get overexerted. If it\u2019s always fresh, it\u2019s always new. And then it keeps that             same, good feeling.\u201d Over the last few years, the piano has become Brown\u2019s instrument of choice. He\u2019s taught himself the basics             online and will often use it as a tool to decompress after a long day. \u201cEvery now and then if I\u2019ve got a headache or I\u2019m stressed out, I\u2019ll sometimes just get on the piano and play             for a little bit,\u201d the fourth-year NBA veteran explains. The next step is to take lessons so that he can reach his goal of performing in front of an audience. \u201cI\u2019m actually looking for a dope pianist to teach me, because I want to do a recital one day,\u201d he says             eagerly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be any time soon, but maybe like two or three years from now.\u201d The machine, on the other hand, has been collecting dust over the last couple of years. Brown admits that he             hasn\u2019t devoted any time to making beats in two years, though it\u2019s something he wants to pick up again. \u201cIt might be something I get back into, for sure,\u201d Brown suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I tried, but it takes             a lot of time, focus and energy, especially to create one from scratch. And right now, I\u2019m all basketball.             But there\u2019s different forms of music and stuff that I\u2019m into. Maybe I\u2019m not making beats right now, but I             think in talking to different people, I want to start learning how to deejay.\u201d When that day comes, Brown knows exactly who he can turn to for guidance. \"I look at music sort of like basketball. I see a rhythm, I see a                 beat \u2013 the beat of the ball sounds like it could be the beat of a drum.\" \"The pace, the motion, the fluidity is all the same.\u201d B/R Mag \u2013 Bleacher Report Jerome Allen, just like Brown, was born into music. The main difference is that Allen came into the world             nearly a quarter of a century earlier, in 1973, which coincidentally was also the birth year of his favorite             genre of music, hip-hop. Though, that\u2019s not the genre on which the fourth-year Celtics assistant coach was raised. Growing up in             Philadelphia, Allen would listen to his grandparents\u2019 and mother\u2019s 8-track and vinyl collection, which was             comprised of a mix between soul and R&amp;B. The collection included the likes of BB King,             Clash Carter, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Four Tops, Howard Melvin and the Blue             Notes, The Main Ingredient and Five Stairsteps, among many others. \u201cMy mother, when she turned the music on, it was either to block my sister and I out, clean, or just to kind             of feel the vibe of a Sunday afternoon,\u201d Allen recalls. \u201cAnd I just kind of gravitated towards it.\u201d Allen particularly began to gravitate toward hip-hop as it began to take off. He started collecting tapes of             his own and would record radio hits on his boombox while listening to Lady B\u2019s Sunday afternoon hip-hop             segment on Power 99. He developed a fondness toward Philly artists and groups, such as Cool C, Schoolly D,             DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Tuff Crew and Three Times Dope. By the time he went off to college at the University of Pennsylvania, Allen\u2019s music collection had grown             quite large. Though, he was just getting started. He and his college friends would often stroll down to the             Funk-O Mart on Market Street in downtown Philly, where they could satisfy all of their musical desires. \u201cSometimes we would spend hours and hours inside the store looking for certain artists or rappers from other             parts of the country,\u201d Allen says. \u201cPlus, I was just recording all the local shows, since at the time you             could record a cassette right off of the radio. I just had all these tapes, listening to music probably when             I should have been in class.\u201d When he wasn\u2019t listening to music, Allen was hooping. The 6-foot-4 guard became one of UPenn\u2019s greatest             players of all time, setting the program record for assists and steals, while also winning consecutive Ivy             League Player of the Year awards in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, Allen was drafted 49th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, which forced him to finally             move out of Philadelphia for the first time in his life. From that point on, he would hardly stay put, as he             would move more than a dozen times over the course of his 14-year pro-ball career. His short-lived NBA             career took him from Minnesota, to Indiana, to Denver and then to Milwaukee. Most of his professional hoops             days, however, were spent over in Europe, where he played for various clubs in France, Turkey, Italy, Spain             and Greece. Allen made his first international stop in 1997 in Limoges, France \u2013 a small city of about 135,000 people and             the home of the Limoges Cercle Saint-Pierre club of the Pro A League. There, he experienced a much different             pace of life than he was used to in the United States. His days in Limoges consisted of waking up, playing             basketball, coming home and, that\u2019s about it. He had never experienced such solitude, especially during the             156-day stretch of rain, which he remembers vividly to this day. By the time he moved onto his next stop in Istanbul, Turkey in 1999, he was ready to start up a new hobby in             order to fill his personal life with a bit more energy. That\u2019s when he got in touch with his newlywedded             wife Aida back home in Philadelphia and asked her if she would go to the store and pick up a set of             turntables for him. \u201cI met with his cousin, who is also a deejay, and we went and purchased all this high-end equipment that I             know nothing about,\u201d Aida recalls. \u201cI\u2019m just there to provide the credit card and to transport these highly             valuable assets of his now to him.\u201d The request came as a total surprise to Aida, and she admittedly questioned it at first. She still remembers             the gist of the conversation she had with her husband right when she arrived at their apartment in Istanbul. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018Oh my goodness. Jerome, are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d  \u201cAida yes!\u201d he insisted.  \u201cDeejaying, really? You can start like anything else, but all this big equipment \u2013 where are you                 going to put it?\u201d \u201cWell, right here,\u201d he said, pointing toward an empty spot in their living room. \u201cRight here?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cIn our living room? Like really? Right here?\u201d \u201cSo yeah, it was a little shocking at first. But it kind of made things really sane, as I think about it.\u201d In other words, it helped to bring completion to her husband\u2019s lifestyle, as it gave him an outlet to turn to             outside of basketball. On top of that, it also brought their family and friends closer together. \u201cEvery time we had a visitor from the US, there had to be a rap battle, like a family rap challenge,\u201d Aida             remembers. \u201cIt was crazy. But it kept us connected, and it kept us entertained, and gave us the ability to             have fun.\u201d Allen even found a way to bring his two worlds together, as he would provide entertainment for his \u00dclkerspor             teammates, as well as players from the 12 other men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams scattered across Turkey\u2019s most             populous city. \u201cOn Sundays, we would all hang out and get together after our games,\u201d Jerome says. \u201cWhether it was eating at             my house, or whether it was me eventually playing music. So it eventually helped me with my downtime, but it             also provided a service to have us just get together.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for Aida to realize how positive of an impact this newfound passion was having on her             husband\u2019s life. He found a new element to thrive in when he wasn\u2019t playing basketball, and it was bringing             out the best in him. \u201cIt\u2019s funny in life how you can just put on so many different masks and have so many different hats, and when             you wear the hat that you love, you see the light,\u201d Aida says. \u201c So that\u2019s just how I see it with him. When             he\u2019s doing that in particular, he\u2019s really shining.\u201d Over time, Allen\u2019s deejaying developed from a hobby into what he now considers to be a part-time profession.             Throughout the years, he\u2019s provided his services in all sorts of capacities, such as clubs, private parties,             barbeque cookouts, baby showers in the Hamptons, and the most difficult of them all \u2013weddings. \u201cI always say, if you can go do a wedding and have the dance floor crowded from the time they open up the             dance floor until the time they pull the plug, you\u2019re probably a pretty good DJ,\u201d Allen claims. \u201cBecause at             most weddings you have the range of age varies from small kids to the elderly. So you\u2019re going to have to             play The Temptations for the older crowd, and you\u2019re going to have to play some Lil Baby for the younger             crowd. But if you can keep everybody engaged and understand the rhythm and who to play for and all that,             then you\u2019re pretty good.\u201d Allen\u2019s good enough that even his four kids seek out his services. Aida says that her husband\u2019s deejaying             helps him to connect with their 24-year-old twins Jerome and Taylor, 18-year-old Jordan and 10-year-old             Roman. \u201cHe deejays all of Jordan\u2019s parties, things at their schools,\u201d Aida says. \u201cThings that her friends might             need, he sends them playlists. Roman, he\u2019s in AAU basketball, so he\u2019s done Christmas parties for his teams.             He does a lot for these kids and they love the music.\u201d As for his other family, the Celtics, let\u2019s just say that some players were skeptical at first. \u201cI remember when he first told us he deejayed,\u201d Jayson Tatum recalls with a hint of doubt in his voice. \u201cYeah, most people when I tell them I deejay, they don\u2019t take me seriously,\u201d Allen laughs. That changed two Decembers ago, however, when Allen showed up to the team\u2019s annual holiday party for homeless             children at the Auerbach Center with his turntables and put on a show to remember. \u201cWhen we had that Christmas party and he was actually deejaying,\u201d Tatum says with a raise of his eyebrows, \u201cI             was like, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d He and Marcus Smart at one point joined Allen in the booth to see how much work he was actually doing. Simply             put \u2013 they were impressed. The whole team was, enough so that they had him run it back for this past             December\u2019s holiday party. \u201cYou could call him like a real deejay,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cLike he\u2019s got all the turntables and he\u2019s got his             laptop and all the playlists and headphones. Like he really knows how to deejay.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got some skills,\u201d adds Smart. \u201cLike he\u2019s got some real skills. He\u2019s definitely better than we             expected.\u201d Allen has offered up his services to the players in case they ever need some live entertainment at a private             event or party. Smart says he hopes to get Allen to deejay at one of his YounGameChanger Foundation events             later this year. As for Tatum, he says he might be giving Allen a call \u201c15 years down the line\u201d from now. \u201cA long, long time             from now if I ever get married, I\u2019ll have him deejay the wedding,\u201d the 21-year-old All-Star says with a             boyish grin. Allen has also told the players that he\u2019s more than willing to teach them how to deejay if they\u2019re open to             learning. No one has taken him up on that offer yet, but he may have at least piqued the interest of one             potential student. After downing the Pelicans, Allen and Brown head back to the locker room, change out of their game day             attire, and then meet up inside the adjacent coaches\u2019 lounge. They sit down to chat, not about the matchup             that just unfolded, but about their shared passion outside the game. Music is a topic that could keep them             talking for hours if they had the time. Brown starts off the conversation on a light note, asking Allen to share his top five most influential             artists, to which the coach rubs his chin in deep thought. He places rappers Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls atop             his list, and then he starts dishing out names in random order: Big Daddy Kane, Stevie Wonder, Babyface, The             Delfonics. About two dozen names later, Brown cuts him off. \u201cOK, we know your Rolodex,\u201d he jokes. Then he starts listing             off some of his favorite artists and producers, all of whom hail from his neck of the woods in and around             Atlanta: OutKast, Zaytoven, Kanye West, Summer Walker, Lil Baby. The two diverse lists say a lot about the generational gap between Allen and Brown. But while their taste in             music may be different, their philosophies are quite similar in that they\u2019ve both found a way to link their             two greatest loves. \u201cFor me, I look at music sort of like basketball,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI see a rhythm, I see a beat \u2013 the beat of             the ball sounds like it could be the beat of a drum. The pace, the motion, the fluidity is all the same. So             music has always been a part of me, and basketball, I look at it the same way. Music is an art. Basketball             is a form of art.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most important forms of art that\u2019s been given to us,\u201d Allen chimes in. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most influential,\u201d Brown adds. \u201cMusic, it can make you happy, it can make you sad, it can get you excited,\u201d says Allen. \u201cIt can make you             move, it can put you in a calm space. It just does so many things. I think all the different genres speak to             how many different ways people can be creative.\u201d In many ways, Allen believes, it\u2019s similar to how basketball players use creativity in their actions on the             court. \u201cFrom a music standpoint, how producers break down sound is pretty much the same way that an unbelievable             offensive player will break down a defender,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the twists, the angles, the sharp cuts, the             flowing movement of the ball being an extension of someone\u2019s hand, the abrupt stops, the changes of             directions and pace \u2013 start, stop, go \u2013 that\u2019s all consistent with music.\u201d Another consistency, Brown notes, is the crowd control factor. Whether it\u2019s an artist on the court or an             artist in the booth, there lies an ability to dictate the environment with the flick of a wrist. \u201cI think it\u2019s the same as playing basketball on a court as you control the crowd while you\u2019ve got the ball in             your hands,\u201d Brown notes. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing when you\u2019re making music and you\u2019re controlling the energy             that\u2019s around you.\u201d Though obviously not every basketball player is capable of deejaying and not every deejay is capable of             playing basketball. It takes a patient, creative mind to be able to do both. Allen possesses such qualities, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been successful in both fields. He also sees such             qualities in Brown, which is why he thinks the young Celtics star could also have a future in deejaying             should he choose to pursue it. \u201cFor one, he\u2019s a thinker,\u201d Allen explains. \u201cSo he slows stuff down long enough to really think about his             composition, and doing that just breaks things apart \u2013 they start to fragment. And if he can do that with             sound and bring it all back together and re-arrange it, there you go. \u201cIt\u2019s like in basketball \u2013 I see him working on the jab-step. But it\u2019s not really just about the jab-step,             because he\u2019s thinking about selling the spin dribble. But he\u2019s starting with the first element of it, which             is to jab step and find the angle and the force at which that movement is credible just to set a guy up for             something else. I\u2019ve seen him stand on the floor and really just be meticulous in just a simple jab, knowing             where he ultimately was going. And that\u2019s just like being a producer \u2013 to extract one simple sound knowing             where they\u2019re going afterward.\u201d While Brown knows where he\u2019s going on the court, he\u2019s still in the process of figuring out where his passion             for music will take him. He\u2019s in no rush to figure that out, nor should he be as his basketball career             continues to climb. But that doesn\u2019t mean Brown\u2019s musical goals won\u2019t be met at some point. He would love to eventually find a             piano instructor so that he can put on a dope recital in a concert hall. He\u2019d like to kick back and learn a             few songs to play on his guitar. And someday, he hopes to learn how to deejay, for which he\u2019ll most likely             turn toward his coach for help. \u201cMy mama told me you could learn a lot from anybody if you\u2019re willing to listen. That if you pay attention,             you can learn a lot,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFor me, a lot of the stuff that I\u2019m interested in I teach myself just             because it just gives me something to do, stay out of trouble, and I like the journey of trying to figure it             out myself. \u201cBut I know if I need advice from anybody, I know where to go,\u201d he adds, nodding toward Allen. \u201cIf I have any             questions or anything like that I\u2019ll definitely be swinging by.\u201d By the time Allen and Brown wrap up their conversation, the locker room has emptied out with the exception of             a couple of attendants tidying up the area. It\u2019s getting late now, which means it\u2019s time for Allen to take             his kids home (once he finds his misplaced car keys). As for Brown, he\u2019s got a performance to catch next door. \"I\u2019ve got some more to learn, maybe take some lessons and learn from                 some people, but I could see myself [deejaying]. It\u2019s                 definitely coming, for sure.\" It\u2019s nearing midnight by the time Brown makes his way up to a private suite in the upper left corner of Big             Night Live. From there, he has a bird\u2019s eye view of Shaq, who is already hard at work behind the raised-up             booth at center-stage. Brown turns his wide-eyed gaze out toward the hundreds of tipsy clubgoers, who are             bobbing around like buoys in a raging sea. The sight aligns perfectly with his thoughts of one day standing             in Shaq\u2019s place on stage. \u201cI don\u2019t really go out like that, and I\u2019m particular with the music I like to listen to,\u201d Brown says. \"So, if             I were to do something, it would make sense to be able to make my own playlist \u2013 be able to show up, and             rather than be the person standing around on their phone, I\u2019ll be the one operating, controlling the scene.\u201d Brown\u2019s face lights up as Shaq transitions into a dubstep rendition of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s m.A.A.D. city, and he             turns his attention back toward the stage. He breaks out in laughter as Shaq, already drenched in sweat,             hypes up the crowd with a series of energetic fist pumps. Many in attendance are sporting \u201cO\u2019Neal\u201d Celtics             and Lakers jerseys, some of which are being held up in the air as tokens of support for the larger-than-life             celebrity. \u201cJust as an athlete, as a part of that whole \u2018shut-up-and-dribble\u2019 movement, just seeing athletes being able             to be outside of the box that people put them in (is admirable),\u201d Brown says. \u201cLike Shaq stopped playing             years ago and I think his brand is still just as relevant as it was when he was playing. So just to see him             is cool, man. Just to see an athlete being respected and being embraced in a different community outside of             what he initially started in I think is really dope.\u201d So dope, in fact, that Brown can picture himself eventually joining the same community. \u201cI definitely want to do it one day,\u201d he says. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ve got some more to learn, maybe take some             lessons and learn from some people, but I could see myself doing that. It\u2019s definitely coming, for sure.\u201d When the day comes that he\u2019s ready to learn, he knows exactly who he can call for advice. DJ Jerome will be there, with turntables in tow, ready to teach DJ Jaylen everything he needs to know about             the craft."}

Now, it\u2019s time for the C\u2019s to return the favor. The team announced Thursday night via a flashy jumbotron video reveal that it will retire Garnett\u2019s No. 5 jersey at some point next season, which means the Big Ticket will officially be punched into the hall of Celtics Legends. The surprise reveal came during the first timeout of Boston\u2019s primetime matchup against the LA Clippers. Just after the whistle blew, the arena\u2019s lights dimmed out and KG\u2019s familiar voice came booming over the public address system. Fans looked up at the jumbotron inquisitively as a seemingly random montage of Garnett quotes and highlights began to play. However, those stares of confusion soon turned into gawks of excitement, as it became abundantly clear what was taking place. Even the current Celtics players got hyped in the moment. Marcus Smart later claimed after his team\u2019s 141-133 double-overtime win, \u201cIt got my blood starting to flow.\u201d The dramatic video ended with a grateful written statement from Garnett, to which the ecstatic fans responded with a standing ovation. \u201cI\u2019m honored and thankful to have my number retired with the Celtics,\u201d it read. \u201cI will always have immense respect and appreciation for ownership, Danny Ainge, Doc Rivers, my past teammates and Celtics Nation!\u201d During his six seasons with the Celtics, from 2007 to 2013, Garnett brought a unique combination of passion, energy, leadership, and desire that helped drive the team to a memorable stretch of success. He started things off with a bang during the 2007-08 season, as he played a pivotal role in guiding the C\u2019s to their NBA-leading 17th championship, while also earning All-NBA First Team honors and becoming the first and only player in franchise history to be named NBA Defensive Player of the Year. \u201cWe knew in 2008 we\u2019d be retiring his number,\u201d Celtics Co-Owner Wyc Grousbeck told NBC Sports Boston Thursday night. \u201cHe came in here and, I won\u2019t say singlehandedly because it was a team effort, but he changed everything the minute he stepped on the court. He provided energy and commitment and drive and passion like no one I\u2019ve ever seen in 17 years.\u201d KG was an All-Star during five of his six seasons in Boston and was named to four NBA All-Defensive Teams during that span. Over the course of his 396 appearances with the Celtics, he averaged 15.7 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.0 blocks in 30.9 minutes per game. \u201cKevin gave everything he had to the Celtics in every practice, in every game,\u201d said Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge. \u201cAnd his unique blend of energy, intelligence, and talent brought out the best in his teammates and coaches.\u201d Garnett\u2019s former head coach just so happened in the building Thursday night for the announcement. Rivers, however, was so focused on getting his Clippers going during the early timeout that he missed the entire thing. Before the game, though, Rivers ironically dished out a heaping pile of praise on Garnett in regard to the lasting impact he had in Boston. \u201cI think he was a great teammate. I don\u2019t think that gets enough play,\u201d Rivers told reporters. \u201cHe was a phenomenal teammate; he was all about winning. His IQ was incredible, it was off the charts. And I\u2019ve often said about him, he\u2019s the greatest superstar role player ever. Like, he was a superstar, but he played his role for the team anyway, somehow. I don\u2019t know why he did that, but he did it. He changed the culture of this franchise. He really did. We needed a guy like that to come to the franchise. And he did that. And it\u2019s still here. It hasn\u2019t left since. So that was all Garnett.\u201d Rivers\u2019 successor, Brad Stevens, concurred that Garnett\u2019s legacy remained in Boston long after he was traded to Brooklyn during the summer of 2013. \u201cHe had a huge impact on everybody that was leftover that was on my staff because he was so good to all those coaches, and then all the players that were leftover as well that played with him,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe was the guy they always pointed to as the best leader they\u2019d been around, on top of the fact that he was elite on both ends of the court.\u201d When a player delivers off the court and on both ends of the court, his legacy will often be eternalized above the court. As such, Garnett will soon see his No. 5 jersey hoisted to the TD Garden Rafters where it rightfully belongs. "}

Make no mistake about this, however: they\u2019re excited to be opponents Sunday night. Walker will be a starter for Team Giannis when the 69th NBA All-Star game tips off at 8 p.m. ET Sunday night at the United Center. Tatum, meanwhile, will be a reserve for the opposing squad, Team LeBron. The two stars spoke Saturday morning at All-Star Media Day about being on opposite teams and made it very clear that they\u2019re looking forward to the experience of playing against one another in the NBA\u2019s showcase game. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fun,\u201d Walker, who spoke to the media first Saturday, said with a big smile. \u201cObviously we play on the same team and see each other all the time, so it\u2019ll be good to get a chance to get out there and go up against him. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Tatum echoed a similar sentiment before immediately diving into the potential of a one-on-one matchup with his 6-foot teammate. \u201cHopefully we get matched up once or twice so I can take him to the post,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go right at him.\u201d Tatum clearly intends to take advantage of his eight-inch height advantage over Walker. Meanwhile, on the other side of the matchup, the speedy point guard intends to give Tatum a dose of his own medicine. \u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna hit him with his own move,\u201d Walker quipped to Celtics.com. \u201cI already got it down pat. I\u2019m gonna hit him with the step-back to the right or left, which he usually does. I\u2019mma get him.\u201d The two players said they don\u2019t have any friendly wagers placed on their impending matchup, but Tatum did say of the proposition, \u201cWe should. That\u2019d be fun.\u201d To the surprise of many in attendance Saturday, Walker revealed that the two players have already gone at each other once this weekend. He said that he and Tatum played a game of NBA 2k against each other Friday. \u201cWe talked a little trash yesterday. We played 2K,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI played with my All-Star team. He played with his team. I won, so right now, I got the head up right now.\u201d Tatum responded by joking that he was just being a good guy by letting Walker win. \u201cI wanted to make him feel good about himself, about the weekend,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta see me tomorrow.\u201d The two players had fun speaking about their friendly competition but also made sure to explain just how special it is for each of them to be here with the other. This is Walker\u2019s fourth All-Star appearance. He has never had a teammate join him for the event. He said that having Tatum in town with him brings a new element to his experience. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest difference, just having a teammate here who I\u2019m able to enjoy it with,\u201d he said. It is a big difference, because these two players aren\u2019t just casual friends. They are two basketball stars who have grown closer and closer to one another since Walker joined the Celtics in July, as Tatum elaborated on Saturday morning. \u201cKemba, that\u2019s my guy,\u201d said Tatum. \u201cOur relationship and friendship has grown a lot over this season so far, from USA Basketball to playing on the Celtics to experiencing All-Star together. It\u2019s been a good ride. We\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d Something tells us one of them will enjoy Sunday a little bit more than the other. After all, only one of them can come out on top with a win, and only one of them can come out on top in their individual matchup. "}

It is a foregone conclusion that he will be enshrined into the Hall this September. The Hall of Fame\u2019s announcement came the day after the Celtics announced that they will retire Garnett\u2019s No. 5 jersey next season.

Garnett was on hand for the event, which took place inside of the Concert Club room at the United Center in front of a large group of basketball royalty and media members. Garnett is one of eight finalists chosen for the 2020 Hall of Fame class, joining Kim Mulkey, Rudy Tomjanovic, Barbara Stevens, Eddie Sutton, Tim Duncan, Tamika Catchings and Kobe Bryant. Shortly after his name was called, Garnett joined NBA TV\u2019s Matt Winer on stage to speak about the emotions he was feeling at that time. \u201cThe Hall of Fame is something you don\u2019t really think about, you don\u2019t really dream about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just happens. I\u2019m more than honored for this. This is over my head. This is one of the more overwhelming situations I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d Later, after the ceremony had come to an end, Garnett stopped in the middle of a doorway at the bottom of a stairwell in the United Center to further comment on the honor to a small group of media members. \u201cEverything kinda stopped, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d he said of the moment his name was called. \u201cI was watching the Kobe (Bryant) video and it just kinda hit home to why we\u2019re all here. G-Hill (Grant Hill) hit me with something when I came in, like, \u2018It\u2019s gonna feel real,\u2019 or something, because it hasn\u2019t. Today made it feel real.\u201d Garnett also commented further on Boston\u2019s decision to retire his number during his impromptu press conference in the middle of the doorway. \u201cI told them I don\u2019t need the Paul Pierce ceremony,\u201d he said with a slight smile, referring to his teammate\u2019s lengthy number retirement ceremony that took place in Feb. of 2018. \u201cI wanna be in here and keep it real simple. But I am very appreciative of them actually at least recognizing.\u201d Garnett will become the 24th player in Celtics history to be honored by having his name or his number raised to the TD Garden rafters, never to be worn again. Garnett, who attended high school in Chicago, has had one heck of a 20-hour stretch back in his old stomping grounds. There are few NBA players who have had their number retired by a historic franchise and become finalists for the Basketball Hall of Fame. Garnett just earned both honors in less than a day. "}

Opposing coaches, meanwhile, are becoming more and more alarmed. When it was mentioned to Doc Rivers ahead of Thursday night\u2019s Celtics-Clippers matchup that the 21-year-old wing has grown even more since his 30-point outing in LA less than three months ago, the Clippers\u2019 head coach couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and laugh. \u201cI hope not,\u201d Rivers responded incredulously. \u201cBecause he was pretty good against us that night. I don\u2019t need any more growth outta him right now.\u201d Even though Rivers may not want to believe it, he can\u2019t help but acknowledge Tatum's growth. \u201cHe\u2019s just taking better shots,\u201d the former Celtics coach stated of the first-time All-Star. \u201cHis shot quality is better than it was last year. He seems just more confident \u2013 free in a very positive way.\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens is equally impressed by the growth of his young pupil, especially being in his presence every day. Stevens believes that such on-court growth coupled with a mature off-court approach will eventually make Tatum into not only one of the greatest players in the league, but also one of its greatest leaders. \u201cYou grow up quickly in this craziness,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe has always had a high, high emotional intelligence to him. He\u2019s always been able to stay above the fray and the moment and not get too high or too low. It\u2019s really impressive. He\u2019s been that way since he got here. You just see the growth in the consistency of his play on both ends of the court. He\u2019s awfully talented. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few talks this year about the goal, both with him and Jaylen, that this is all for naught if at 28, 29, 30, they\u2019re not two of the better leaders around. They\u2019re both really trending in that direction. They\u2019re both going to be excellent.\u201d When Rivers considers Tatum\u2019s future, it causes him to become even more amazed (and maybe a little nervous). \u201cCan you imagine five years from now what he\u2019ll be?\u201d Rivers pondered. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the better players in the league and an All-Star, yet we\u2019re still talking about how young and how much better he\u2019ll be. He\u2019s going to be amazing. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s in the East.\u201d - Taylor Snow "}

The matchup is the last for each team before Sunday's star-studded showcase. The Celtics are looking to rebound from a 116-105 loss to the Houston Rockets on Tuesday that snapped their seven-game winning streak. Boston has won six straight at home, where it is 22-5 on the season. The Clippers are similarly looking to bounce back after a 110-103 setback at the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday. Los Angeles is 1-2 entering the finale of its four-game road trip and 15-12 away from home overall. Thursday's contest concludes the season series between the teams after the Celtics fell to the Clippers 107-104 in overtime in Los Angeles on Nov. 20. Jayson Tatum led Boston with 30 points in that game, while Lou Williams paced L.A. with 27 off the bench. Tatum had a streak of nine straight games scoring 20 or more points snapped when he was held to 15 on 5-of-15 shooting in Tuesday's loss to the Rockets. Gordon Hayward instead led the way with 20 points, and Jaylen Brown had 19 before exiting the contest late in the fourth quarter with a left calf contusion. Brown is listed as probable for Thursday's tilt. \"My team needs me out there,\" Brown said Tuesday night. \"So I'm going to try and push through it for those guys.\" Brown has been battling an ankle injury that caused him to miss a game last week and a couple more in late January. Boston as a whole has been banged up of late, with Tatum's hot streak helping the team still win 10 of 11 prior to the game at Houston. \"There's a lot of things that we gotta work on from this game, to learn from, but it's not the end of the world,\" Tatum said after the loss. \"It's one game. On to the next one.\" Paul George and the Clippers are of a similar mindset after their loss Tuesday. George was held to 11 points on 3-of-15 shooting in one of his worst performances of the season, but Kawhi Leonard scored 30 points to keep Los Angeles in it. \"We fought to the end,\" Leonard said. \"They made a push and, I mean, they played better tonight.\" Coach Doc Rivers added: \"I thought we lost the game because we didn't play with any continuity offensively.\" The Clippers are still finding their groove with forward Marcus Morris Sr., acquired from the New York Knicks prior to last week's trade deadline. Morris scored 13 playing alongside Leonard and George against Philadelphia after putting up 10 with Leonard out in his L.A. debut Sunday. Morris played two seasons from 2017-19 with the Celtics, averaging 13.8 points per game in that time. For the Clippers, guard Patrick Beverley will miss his fourth straight game Thursday due to a groin injury. "}

What it largely came down to, was a lack of both patience and discipline on the defensive end. Boston committed 26 personal fouls, which led the Rockets to a 37-of-42 performance from the free-throw line, marking the most such makes and attempts the Celtics have allowed all season. The C\u2019s, meanwhile, ended up with 17 fewer free-throw makes (20) and attempts (25), which proved to be all the difference during their 116-105 loss at Toyota Center. What hurt the C\u2019s, particularly down the stretch, was biting on pump fakes from long distance and the mid-range. They fouled Houston on multiple threes and deep twos, most of which were drawn by James Harden (18 attempts) and Russell Westbrook (13 attempts). \u201cYou gotta do your best to guard them hard without fouling,\u201d C\u2019s coach Brad Stevens said following the defeat. \u201cI think a lot of teams, and us too, you get tentative because you are concerned about the foul. So that probably was part of it and we just didn't have our normal ball pressure. But they put you in a tough spot. They're good.\u201d Though against players like Harden and Westbrook, who are elite at drawing contact, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely easier said than done,\"      according to Gordon Hayward. \"They attack, just their ability to hit shots makes you want to jump. Certainly, we\u2019ve got to be better at that.\u201d And typically, they are. Boston entered the night allowing an average of 23.5 free-throw attempts per game, proving that this was an anomaly. But it still served as a great reminder, especially for the younger players, about how important it is to be patient and disciplined while defending jumpers. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being in that moment \u2013 knowing not to jump on a shot fake, but you do it,\u201d said Jayson Tatum, who found himself guarding Harden on several defensive possessions. \u201cWe\u2019ve just gotta be better. There\u2019s a lot of things that we gotta work on from this game, to learn from, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s one game. On to the next one.\u201d The Celtics are also excited that they\u2019ll get a chance to see Houston again in the near future. They\u2019ll host the Rockets back home in Boston on Feb. 29, and they\u2019ll be ready to make amends. \u201cWe had some really bad fouls, but we\u2019ll see these guys soon again,\u201d said Kemba Walker, who took responsibility for biting on a couple of fakes late in the game. \u201cWe\u2019ll be better next time. We\u2019ll be ready and more prepared.\u201d "}

Jayson Tatum and his crew took down arguably the most talented team in the NBA Thursday night during the NBA\u2019s finale before the All-Star break. Tatum led all scorers with 39 points and spearheaded Boston\u2019s push toward the winner\u2019s circle during a double-overtime thriller. Tatum scored nearly every bucket for Boston that was of absolute necessity. The final came as a dagger during double-overtime. Landry Shamet had just forced an ill-advised shot in transition that was blocked by Grant Williams. The Celtics led by two as they took the ball in the opposite direction and approached the the two-minute mark. This was their chance to make it a two-possession game. And they did. Tatum did. Tatum caught a pass near midcourt from Grant Williams and waved his teammates off. He wanted to go at his defender, Landry Shamet, just as he had for much of the night. Boston\u2019s budding superstar did Shamet dirty yet again on this play. He slowly approached Shamed with a dribble, causing Shamet to back up, and then hit Shamet with a nasty crossover from right to left. Tatum had an open jumper from 20 feet after that move, but instead of shooting, he continued to do work. As Shamet attempted to recover, Tatum drove hard with his left hand and beat Shamet yet again \u2013 for the second time in two seconds \u2013 off the dribble. He rose up into the air and was greeted by Montrezl Harrell\u2019s 240-pound body, which couldn\u2019t prevent Tatum from dropping in a layup in with 2:01 left on the clock. LA immediately called for a timeout as Tatum flexed, screamed and celebrated his final bucket of the night \u2013 a bucket that gave Boston a 134-130 lead and which felt like the final dagger in the coffin for the Clippers. Boston never let LA have possession of the ball with a chance to tie or take a lead from that point on. Gordon Hayward prevented that from happening with his seven straight points for the C\u2019s, including a clutch 3-pointer just 25 seconds after Tatum\u2019s driving layup. This was a statement win for Boston, and it was a statement performance by Tatum. The Celtics downed the team many consider to be the title favorite, and Tatum moved himself right into the MVP conversation with a performance for the ages. Kawhi Leonard might be the best basketball player in the world. Jayson Tatum outperformed him by a landslide Thursday night in front of a national audience. What\u2019s that say about Boston\u2019s 21-year-old wing, who this Sunday will be making his first appearance in the NBA All-Star game? You know what it says: that Tatum is making his way toward that conversation as well. Tatum was nothing short of magnificent against the Clippers while scoring a game-high 39 points on 14-for-23 shooting. That\u2019s a 60.9-percent conversion rate, which included a 5-for-10 performance from long distance. What stood out most in this game was that Tatum was at his best when it mattered most. He scored seven points on 3-for-4 shooting during the fourth quarter, eight points on 2-for-3 shooting during the first overtime, and the two most important points of the second overtime. Tatum neared a double-double thanks to the nine rebounds he hauled in, which trailed only Gordon Hayward\u2019s 13 on the Celtics. He also contributed one assist, one steal and one blocked shot on the night. What also must not be ignored is the defense Tatum played against Leonard. He is the player who forced Leonard into a critical miss on an isolation play with 40 seconds left in overtime. He is the player who forced Leonard into a critical miss on a 3-pointer midway through the second overtime. Reminder: that was against arguably the best player in the entire world, and while Tatum was scoring at a high volume in crunch time at the other end of the court. If Tatum\u2019s coming out party was during the playoff run of his rookie season, this was his noisy arrival into the MVP conversation. He's here to stay.

The Rockets used the free-throw line. They used their superstars. They used their role players. The combination of those three areas allowed Houston to string together a 20-4 run that turned a two-point game into an 18-point game as the matchup entered the final two minutes. The run began at the free-throw line, where James Harden and P.J. Tucker combined to hit five straight freebies in a matter of just 12 seconds. Daniel House Jr. then sandwiched five points around a driving layup from Russell Westbrook, before Harden got back into the act with three more free throws. His three freebies put Houston up 111-98 with 3:09 remaining in the game, which borderline put the game away. But the Rockets still added more cushion. Westbrook and Harden, who combined to score 78 points in the game, got right back into the action by scoring the final five points of the run via another driving layup from Westbrook and another trey from Harden. Harden\u2019s 3-pointer was scored with 1:56 left in the game. Houston subbed him and three other starters out of the game at the next dead ball before it wrapped up a 116-105 victory. Consistent. Reliable. Underrated. All of those words describe Gordon Hayward and his strong performance Tuesday night in Houston. Hayward continued to do what he\u2019s done all season, which is to fly under the radar while providing the Celtics with the type of all-around play that stabilizes the team on a nightly basis. Tuesday night, he stuffed the stat sheet with 20 points, eight rebounds, six assists and a blocked shot. His 20 points and six assists each led the team, while his eight boards finished second behind Jayson Tatum\u2019s and Daniel Theis\u2019 nine boards each. His shooting numbers continued their upward trend as well. Hayward shot 8-for-14 from the field, 2-for-3 from 3-point range, and 2-for-2 from the free-throw line. He is now shooting 51.4 percent from the field, 39.3 percent from long range and 87.2 percent from the charity stripe. Hayward is on track to set new career-best marks in overall field goal percentage and free throw percentage, and he has a shot to catch the best bulk 3-point shooting season of his career as well (41.5 percent in 2012-13).

On Sunday against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Celtics' rotation was fully intact, and the results were, as expected, favorable. Boston extended its winning streak to seven games with a 112-111 win over the Thunder, and now the Celtics will seek their 11th victory in 12 games on Tuesday against the host Houston Rockets. Fully armed for the first time this month, the Celtics had all five starters score in double figures. Jaylen Brown and Daniel Theis entered questionable due to ankle injuries, but Brown scored 17 points in 34 minutes while Theis contributed a double-double (13 points and 11 rebounds). \"We have a lot of weapons and a lot of guys that can do a lot of different things,\" said Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, who also posted a double-double (13 points, 10 boards). \"If everyone makes the right play and trusts everybody, we have such good players that good things will happen.\" That appears to be more a statement of fact than subjective opinion. The Celtics entered Monday fifth in the NBA in offensive rating (112.7 points per 100 possessions), third in defensive rating (105.5) and second to the Milwaukee Bucks in net rating (plus-7.2). Boston ranks in the top 10 in turnover rate and true shooting percentage, reflections of its offensive efficiency. The defense remains one of the most stifling in the NBA, and that two-way prowess has the Celtics rolling as the unofficial midpoint of the schedule comes into focus on the horizon. The Rockets aren't quite as hot, although their recent play is cause for optimism. Houston lost at the buzzer at home on Sunday, with Jazz forward Bojan Bogdanovic sinking a 28-foot 3-pointer over James Harden and P.J. Tucker to lift Utah to a 114-113 comeback victory. Despite shooting poorly from the perimeter over the final three periods -- the Rockets made 10 of 33 3-point attempts after a blistering start -- and again surrendering a double-digit advantage on the glass (minus-12), the Rockets performed ably on offense in the waning moments. Robert Covington and Tucker hit clutch 3-pointers, the latter providing Houston a lead with 1.6 seconds left. By playing small ball and spreading the floor, the Rockets appear to have optimized their shot selection. Their relative lack of success from behind the arc against the Jazz was no deterrent. \"I think we get the shots that we want taken,\" Rockets guard Russell Westbrook said. \"Open shots, open looks. Depends on what kind of defense you see every night, so we're just trying to read and see what's going on.\" Given their recent commitment to a more exaggerated style of play, the Rockets expect growing pains along the way, and not specifically to the integration of the newly acquired Covington. There will be moments of hesitation and trepidation as the Rockets settle in, but the results thus far have been positive. \"I'm really encouraged by what we're doing and how we can be,\" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said.

Celtics coach Brad Stevens, on three separate occasions, referred to Houston\u2019s defense as a group of \u201clinebackers\u201d ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s matchup at Toyota Center. And those linebackers, such as 6-foot-5, 245-pound center P.J. Tucker, will drive you into the ground if you\u2019re not ready. \u201cThey're really good defensively as far as when they go small, they're just so physical,\u201d Stevens said ahead of tip-off. \u201cYou think because they're small that most things are a good idea, but they're so strong. They're built like linebackers all the way across the board. So posting is tough against these guys, even for bigger wings or centers or whoever the case may be. So I think the movement is appropriate. We\u2019ve gotta make sure that we do the right thing spacing wise, and we can't turn it over. If we turn it over, Harden gets run-outs.\u201d Stevens believes that Houston\u2019s most \u201cspecial\u201d defensive trait is its ability to switch one through five. The key to combating such a system is to keep the ball moving at all times. \u201cYou can\u2019t stare at switches,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou can\u2019t post those guys out at 18 feet, which they push you out to \u2026 If you start staring at the post, you\u2019re playing into their hands. If we start isolating and over-dribbling and all that stuff, it\u2019s probably not a good sign for us.\u201d If the Celtics keep the ball moving, though, and don\u2019t get caught staring at Houston\u2019s constantly moving defense, they should find themselves in a good position to achieve success. - Taylor Snow "}

Combined, the backcourt mates are averaging 62.5 points, 14.6 assists and 14.5 rebounds per game, which makes them by far the most potent offensive tandem in the NBA. \u201cTheir aggressiveness, their mentality \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep coming at you,\u201d Jaylen Brown told Celtics.com ahead of Tuesday morning\u2019s shootaround at Toyota Center. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be consistent, stable and you\u2019ve got to be disciplined against them.\u201d Of the two superstars, Harden is the one who tends to garner most of the attention. And with good reason, considering that he\u2019s in line to capture his third consecutive NBA scoring title. But it\u2019s far from easy coming up with a strategy to defend such a well-rounded offensive weapon as Harden, especially when he\u2019s got a player of Westbrook\u2019s caliber by his side. \u201cIt's a tough one because a lot of teams have gone to full-out doubling him every time, run and jump and don't let him get his rhythm,\u201d Celtics coach Stevens said when asked about the defensive strategy against Harden. \u201cBut then he gets out in transition and is even more aggressive because he knows that's the time he is matched up one-on-one. And it's really opened up the court for a lot of other guys and those other guys are playing well. \u201cThey've got a lot of shooting, and then Westbrook, he's averaging 27 (points) a game. When people talk about Houston, they always talk about Harden, rightfully so. He's special. But Westbrook's a former MVP and you just overhelp and you let him get a head of steam or you let him get cuts or run-ins or run through it on the drive, it's really tough. So I think you've gotta balance the doubling with guarding (Harden) appropriately. We'll have a number of guys that have a number of chances to guard him on different possessions.\u201d Marcus Smart, per usual, plans to be one of the Celtics who takes on such a challenge. \u201cYou just have make everything he takes hard,\u201d Smart said of defending Harden. \u201cMake him work for it. Don\u2019t let him get comfortable. Everything that he takes, shots outside to inside, make them as tough as possible without trying to foul.\u201d Defending Westbrook is just as difficult. The 6-foot-3 point guard is coming off of back-to-back masterpieces against two defensively gifted teams in the Lakers and Jazz, against whom he put up 41 points and 39 points respectively. What makes Westbrook unique is his elite slashing ability, as he is leading the league with 20.3 drives per game while shooting 58.2 percent on such plays. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most explosive players to ever play basketball \u2013 to play any sport,\u201d Stevens claimed. \u201cHe can get to the rim no matter who\u2019s guarding him. He\u2019s just hard to guard. I know that the Lakers mixed their bigs up on him, Rudy (Gobert) guarded him some yesterday \u2013 not the whole time, but some. He\u2019s just hard to keep in front. And Harden draws so much attention, that when you are scrambling out, and then you\u2019ve got to guard a guy that\u2019s a jet engine flying into the paint, it\u2019s just hard.\u201d With that being said, the Celtics can\u2019t wait to see how their third-ranked defense stacks up against Houston\u2019s two-headed monster. \u201cAs a competitor, when you love to compete, you love challenges like this because it only helps you, in the long run, get better,\u201d said Smart. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a fun game, a good game.

Defensively, he helped limit Adams, a 60-percent shooter, to just four points on 2-of-10 shooting. \u201cHe did a really good job and he plays stronger than his weight would indicate,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of Theis following the game. \u201cI thought he did a lot of good things.\u201d One of those good things was the way in which he battled on the boards. Despite the four-inch height disadvantage, Theis was able to match Adams\u2019 game-high rebounding tally of 11, which included five on the offensive end. \u201cI just try to box him out early,\u201d Theis said of his rebounding strategy against Adams. \u201cI try to work him early so he doesn\u2019t have position. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t.\u201d Theis\u2019 impact went well beyond his matchup with Adams, though, as he made his presence felt against many of OKC\u2019s offensive weapons. A few of his greatest defensive contributions actually came while switching onto smaller, speedier guards, including during crunch time against 10-time All-Star Chris Paul. \u201cWhat he's great at is covering for us all,\u201d Stevens explained. \u201cHe'll guard those [bigs] as hard as he can, but it's still hard to keep Adams from getting a bucket every now and then, or (Nerlens) Noel's rolls, or the big guys that he guards night-in, night-out. But what he does is he sniffs out issues with everyone else and covers for us. He does so much that doesn't go into the box score. Even on that last play, he had (Chris) Paul and guarded Paul on one of the last plays of the game. His length bothered the shot. He just does a lot of good things.\u201d Gordon Hayward claims that Theis has been doing such good things for the C\u2019s all season long. \u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous protecting the rim for us being an anchor defensively, always challenging guys at the rim,\u201d the veteran wing stated. \u201cAnd then offensively, he\u2019s just got a great feel for the game \u2013 screening, rolling, half-rolling, popping. Today, I think he did a good job of passing it as well. He\u2019s been instrumental to our success.\u201d Many of Theis\u2019 contributions also fly under the radar, which is why Kemba Walker believes that he is \u201cdefinitely underrated.\u201d \u201cHe just does so many things that don\u2019t show up on the stat sheet, and he never complains,\u201d Walker elaborated. \u201cHe just wants to win and help us be at our best every night \u2026 He just battles every night, gets his butt kicked every night just because of the work he puts in. He\u2019s a smart player. He\u2019s fun to have around. He loves basketball, loves to compete. You can\u2019t ask for more than that.\u201d Such qualities were missed during Theis\u2019 three-game injury absence, but he returned just in time Sunday afternoon to help the C\u2019s muscle their way past Adams and OKC\u2019s highly-skilled offense for their seventh straight win.

The keyword in that statement is \u201cdriving,\u201d because that\u2019s an offensive area in which Tatum has improved tremendously over the course of this season. During the first month and a half of the campaign, Tatum shot just 38.2 percent on 5.8 driving field goal attempts per game. Since Dec. 1, however, that number has rocketed all the way up to 52.2 percent on 6.3 driving FGA per game. During that time span, Tatum ranks eighth in the NBA in driving efficiency among players who have shot with equal or greater volume. On that list, he sits behind an elite group of finishers which includes the likes of Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Damien Lillard, Ja Morant, and Donovan Mitchell, respectively. The difference from earlier in the season to now, Tatum explained to Celtics.com Monday afternoon, is that he\u2019s \u201ctrying to be more patient, and just trying to be more under control when I go to the basket.\u201d Tatum\u2019s positional coach, Jay Larranaga, has also taken note of his improved patience over time. \u201cI think he\u2019s really doing a good job of preparing to score,\u201d the Celtics assistant coach explained following Monday\u2019s practice at Toyota Center in Houston. \u201cPreparing to beat his man, create penetration, just all the things we\u2019re trying to do offensively. \u201cHe is doing just a much better job of moving without the ball, of setting his man up when he\u2019s coming off of an off-ball screen, of setting up his man to use the screen in a pick-and-roll situation. So I just think he\u2019s like all young players; it takes time to figure out the speed of the game and be patient and not skip steps. Especially when you\u2019re so talented that you\u2019ve been able to skip steps and still get away with it your whole life.\u201d Tatum understands that it\u2019s much harder to skip steps in the NBA, so he\u2019s had to adjust. In doing so, he\u2019s noticed a big difference in the way he was finishing earlier in his career to the manner in which he is now. \u201cI feel like I was kind of rushing, trying to get it off too fast,\u201d said Tatum, who on Monday earned the first Eastern Conference Player of the Week recognition of his career. \u201cBut playing off of two feet kind of helps out a lot. And just trying to be more under control.\u201d A great example of Tatum\u2019s improved patience and control took place Sunday afternoon in Oklahoma City, where he pulled off one of the most impressive finishes of his young career to tie up the game early in the fourth quarter. Take a look below. Yup. Looks like an All-Star to me. pic.twitter.com/ltEgdr3e9r \u201cOn a play like that, it demonstrates how he\u2019s becoming more and more patient,\u201d Larranaga said. \u201cHe came off a pick-and-roll, didn\u2019t really get separation from his man, so he stopped, came off a second pick-and-roll, and then he was attacking Steven Adams downhill, and then a really spectacular finish.\u201d The multiple adjustments Tatum made on that play are what really stood out. He lost his first defender, Terrance Ferguson, momentarily on a crossover, was then able to split in between Ferguson and Adams at the beginning of his drive, and finally had enough body control to contort his way around Hamidou Diallo at the rim before finishing on an extremely tough angle. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you can plan on,\u201d he said of the instinctual approach he takes during such drives. \u201cYou\u2019ve just gotta make quick decisions. That\u2019s what we try to do as basketball players.\u201d Through his driving, Tatum also tries to open things up for his teammates. \u201cMost of the time when you drive, you can get a shot off, but sometimes the big converges so someone will be open for a kick-out or a drop-off or something like that,\u201d he explained. Added Larranaga, \u201cHis job is to make the game easier for all of his teammates. His job is to make the right decision on each play offensively and defensively. So when you have somebody that talented and that skilled with that kind of focus on just making the right play and making the game easier for his teammates, it\u2019s really fun to be a part of.\u201d Unless you\u2019re the opposing defense. In that case, Tatum is just going to drive you crazy. "}

Boston led Sunday\u2019s matchup with the Thunder by only three points as the game entered the final 10 seconds. Oklahoma City had possession of the ball with a chance to tie the game. The Thunder didn\u2019t even get a shot off to do so, thanks to Smart. Oklahoma City looked toward its young star, Gilgeous-Alexander, to give the team its critical bucket. But as he made his move to his left on the left wing, Smart reached in with his left hand and poked the ball loose with 5.8 seconds left in the game. Smart then picked up the loose ball and got it to Kemba Walker, who was streaking toward Boston\u2019s basket, and Walker was fouled and sent to the free-throw line with 3.4 seconds left. Walker made one of the two free throws to ostensibly seal the win. Chris Paul swished home a 3-pointer at the buzzer to make the final score 112-111 in favor of Boston. That bucket serves as a reminder of just how important Smart\u2019s steal was. His play prevented Oklahoma City from even having an opportunity to tie the game just seconds earlier. This was the definition of a winning play, which Smart, an All-Defensive First Teamer, not surprisingly made with his defensive skills. Daniel Theis was great Sunday afternoon. He returned to the lineup after missing the last two games with a right ankle sprain and put forth what is in contention for his best all-around performance as a member of the Celtics. He stuffed the stat sheet with 13 points, 11 rebounds and five assists during his 30-plus minutes of action. Those numbers might make your eyes widen, but you must remember that Theis\u2019 job is not to put up gaudy numbers. Still, he found a way to log his fourth double-double of the season while tying Chris Paul for the game\u2019s top assist mark with five. The big man\u2019s 11 boards also tied teammate Jayson Tatum and Thunder big man Steven Adams for the game\u2019s top mark. Theis shot 5-for-11 from the field, 1-for-4 from long distance and 2-for-4 from the free-throw line. He did not commit a single turnover during the game, all while helping to limit Adams to just four points. Brad Stevens on Marcus Smart's game-sealing steal "}

It\u2019s the first time in his three-year NBA career he\u2019s received Player of the Week honors. Tatum, 21, averaged 29.8 points (3rd in Eastern Conference) on 50.0% shooting (53.8% 3-PT) to go along with 7.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.0 steal, and 1.3 blocked shots in an undefeated four-game week at Atlanta (2/3), vs. Orlando (2/5), vs. Atlanta (2/7) and at Oklahoma City (2/9). He scored at least 25 points in all four contests, extending his current career streak of 20-point games to nine (Jan. 18 to present). The third-year forward shot 21-for-39 from beyond the arc throughout the week, including a career-high seven 3-pointers (of 12) against the Hawks on Feb. 7. Tatum also reached the 30-point mark in back-to-back games against Orlando (33 points) and Atlanta (32 points), marking the first time in his NBA career he\u2019s scored at least 30 points in consecutive games. Tatum is the second Celtics player to earn Player of the Week honors this season, joining Jaylen Brown who has received two such awards in 2019-20. In 48 games played this season (all starts), Tatum has produced career highs in points (22.2 ppg), rebounds (6.9 rpg), assists (2.9 apg), steals (1.3 spg) and blocked shots (0.9 bpg). He was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in his career on Jan. 30, making him the second-youngest Celtics player to ever be selected to an All-Star Game (Antoine Walker). "}

It had been just over a year since the superstar scorer was dealt to New Jersey, and in his first return he had burned the Raptors for 39 points, shooting 15-for-26 in a 101-80 Nets win on April 15, 2005. His second time as a visitor in Toronto would become a legendary game, one that YES Network will broadcast Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. Prior to the game, YES will have exclusive interviews with Caris LeVert and Hall of Famer Jason Kidd, beginning at 7 p.m. Let\u2019s backtrack a little to set the scene. The fifth overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft after going to two Final Fours with North Carolina, Carter was a sensation from the moment he hit the league, making his debut in February 1999 at the start of a lockout-shortened season. He was named Rookie of the Year a few months later. The following season he won the Slam Dunk contest with a legendary performance and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. In year three, Carter was named to the All-NBA Second Team and led the Raptors to their first playoff series win before they were eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers on Philly\u2019s run to the NBA Finals. In that summer of 2001, the Nets made a transformative trade, with the acquisition of Jason Kidd fueling consecutive runs to the NBA Finals and three straight Atlantic Division titles. But by December of 2004, Carter\u2019s relationship with the Raptors had turned sour, and the Nets were off to a rough start. On Dec. 17, 2004, the day they traded for Carter, the Nets lost to Memphis to fall to 7-15. Share Links: To get Carter, the Nets dealt Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams, and two first-round picks. The previous summer, they had received three first-round picks in the deal that sent Kenyon Martin to Denver. The Nets would actually play in Toronto two nights later, but Carter did not play. He would average 27.5 points in 57 games for the Nets that season as the Nets went 35-25 after the trade to finish 42-40. When the Nets arrived in Toronto for their Jan. 8, 2006 game, they and Carter were on a hot streak. Two weeks earlier, he had scored a career-high 51 points against Miami. Against the Raptors, Carter went for 42 points on 18-for-35 shooting, including 3-for-5 from 3-point range. He added 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals, with his 3-pointer in the final seconds lifting the Nets to their 105-104 win. Jason Kidd\u2019s handoff to Carter for the winning shot was his 15th assist of the game. Thank you, @mrvincecarter15. pic.twitter.com/24zPVy1unX It was the 10th straight win for the Nets, with Carter averaging 33.5 points per game during the stretch. The Nets would go on to win the Atlantic Division for the fourth time in five seasons, with a 49-33 mark that matched their second-best NBA record. Carter averaged 24.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.2 steals during the 2005-06 season. Carter remained with the Nets through the 2008-09 season. His scoring average of 23.6 points is the highest in the franchise\u2019s NBA era and third in team history behind Hall of Famers Rick Barry and Julius Erving. His 23.4 points per game over 403 games with Toronto is the highest career scoring average in Raptors\u2019 history. When Carter visited the Nets with the Atlanta Hawks on Jan. 9, 2019, a tribute video was presented on the arena scoreboard, though Carter decided to play for one more season. He visited the Nets for the last time on Jan. 12, 2020. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t in this building, but nevertheless the feeling is the same,\u201d Carter told the Associated Press in January 2019. \u201cMy five years was fun, a lot of fun. J-Kidd made it obviously easy to play the game up and down and create a lot of highlights and memories, so it was awesome to see.\u201d "}

With the NBA on hiatus, LeVert has been living a status quo that seems routine across the league: keeping up on his conditioning as best he can with bike and weight workouts while mixing in some virtual competition: NBA2K, Madden, FIFA. In addition, Grady and LeVert took time to revisit a more recent scoring explosion \u2014 LeVert\u2019s 51-point game in Boston on March 3. On the final night of a four-game road trip, LeVert led the Nets back from 21 points down to a 129-120 overtime win. He shot 17-of-26 and 5-of-10 from 3-point range, scoring 26 points in the fourth quarter \u2014 18 in the final 4:05 of regulation \u2014 and another 11 in overtime. It was part of a hot stretch of basketball for LeVert, who had returned to action in early January after missing two months with a thumb injury. Beginning Feb. 3, he averaged 24.1 points while shooting 41.3 percent from 3-point range, along with 5.3 assists, 4.8 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game over 16 games up until the season was suspended. Along the way, he joined Kyrie Irving, Vince Carter, and Stephon Marbury as the only players to register both a 50-point game and a triple-double as a Net. \u201cMine was in the span of a week,\u201d said LeVert of the two accomplishments, \u201cso I was playing really good basketball at the time, and we were winning games as well, so it was definitely a good time.\u201d Against the Celtics, LeVert had gotten off to a fast start, scoring 14 in the first half before a quiet third quarter. But down the stretch, he came alive. \u201cI feel like in the first quarter everybody\u2019s kind of getting their feet wet a little bit, and then in the fourth quarter, everybody\u2019s locked in,\u201d LeVert told Grady. \u201cYou score buckets in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s that much harder than the first quarter. Everybody\u2019s kind of feeling the game out when the game first starts, but in the fourth everybody wants to win and they feel like every possession matters.\u201d LeVert recalled it as one of his two most memorable NBA games, along with Game 1 of the playoffs last season, when he scored 23 points in the Nets\u2019 win in Philadelphia. \u201cIt was a different type of feeling,\u201d said LeVert. \u201cI\u2019ve never scored that many points before; middle school, high school, AAU, nothing. I had never really been in that type of zone before, but it was extremely fun and it felt good to get the win too.\u201d The Nets were still down by 13 midway through the fourth quarter before LeVert drained three consecutive 3-pointers to make it a 104-100 game with 2:41 remaining. But they traded baskets with the Celtics over the next two-plus minutes and were still down five with 10 seconds to go. \u201cI was trying to get a stop because we were still down,\u201d said LeVert. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really get a stop. They were scoring too, that\u2019s what people don\u2019t realize. I would hit a three and they would hit a three. We hit a three, they would get an and-1. We didn\u2019t really stop them too much. And then we finally got a stop and hit another three, and I\u2019m like, \u2018oh, we\u2019ve got a shot at this.\u2019\u201d What happened next falls into the highly improbable category. DeAndre Jordan\u2019s dunk cut it to three with 6.7 seconds left, and on the Boston inbound, Rodions Kurucs tied up Kemba Walker to force a jump ball. The Nets won the tip and called a timeout with 1.4 seconds left, trailing 118-115. The Nets naturally went to LeVert on the inbounds for the final shot, and the Celtics wisely sent three players at him outside the 3-point line. But in the crowd of bodies and waving arms, LeVert drew a foul and went to the line for three shots. He said it was the first time he\u2019d ever been in that position, but he had no problem draining all three shots to force overtime. \u201cWe knew it was going be tough, especially when we came out and then the way that they were guarding us,\u201d said LeVert. \u201cIf you watch the play they were just standing at the 3-point line and we were down three so we needed a three, so we knew it was going be tough to even get the ball in to get a shot off. I think I started under the basket and I was supposed to come off a screen to the top and catch and shoot. But there was like three guys there as soon as I caught it. \u201cAs I went up for a shot, I saw, I think it was (Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot), wide open in the middle and I was going hit TLC. As I\u2019m going up to pass, somebody \u2014 I think it was Marcus Smart \u2014 grabbed my arm, so I just kind of went up for a shot. I\u2019m like, I know he didn\u2019t just grab my arm like that? And they called it. At first I didn\u2019t think they were going call it, but I guess it was super blatant. Especially when I watched it on the replay; I\u2019m like, that was very blatant. I feel like they had to.\u201d In the overtime, LeVert quickly gave the Nets an eight-point lead. He ended up outscoring the Celtics 11-2 in the extra period, scoring all of Brooklyn\u2019s points. \u201cIt was super-special,\u201d said LeVert. \u201cI think especially for fans and people around the world to see the Nets, because I believe it was on TNT as well. We don\u2019t really get a lot of those games. It was huge for us to play on national television and beat a good team like that on the road. It was a good night for a lot of different things.\u201d "}

April 23, 1973 The Nets hire Kevin Loughery as head coach. An 11-year NBA veteran after playing collegiately at St. John\u2019s, Loughery finished the 1972-73 season as player/coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, then retired as a player and took the Nets\u2019 coaching position. He led the Nets to ABA titles in 1974 and 1976 and remains the longest-tenured coach in franchise history, fired during the 1980-81 season. Loughery is the franchise leader in coaching wins with a 297-318 record. He later coached Atlanta, Chicago \u2014 where his former Nets assistant coach Rod Thorn was the GM who hired him \u2014 Washington, and Miami. April 23, 2012 The Nets play their final game in New Jersey after 35 seasons dating back to the 1977-78 season. The state was the franchise\u2019s original home, as the New Jersey Americans were one of the ABA\u2019s charter franchises during the 1967-68 season. After playing nine seasons on Long Island, the Nets returned to New Jersey for their second NBA season in 1977-78. They played their first four seasons at the Rutgers Athletic Center before moving into the brand-new Brendan Byrne Arena \u2014 later to known as Continental Airlines Arena and IZOD Center \u2014 for the 1981-82 season. After 29 seasons at the Meadowlands, with the move to Brooklyn on the horizon, the Nets moved to Newark\u2019s Prudential Center for their final two seasons in New Jersey. April 24, 1976 The Nets defeat the San Antonio Spurs in Game 7 to advance to the ABA championship series. With the league crumbling around them, the Nets pushed on towards capturing the ABA\u2019s final title with a 121-114 win at Nassau Coliseum. Four Nets scored 20-plus points in the win, led by Julius Erving\u2019s 28. John Williamson had 26, Rich Jones had 25, and Brian Taylor scored 20. The Nets would go on to beat the Denver Nuggets in six games in the championship series. April 25, 2004 The Nets beat the Knicks 100-94 to seal a four-game sweep of their first-round playoff series. Kenyon Martin scores 36 points with 13 rebounds in the win, while Jason Kidd has 20 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists. Martin averaged 14 rebounds per game in the series. The Nets would go on to drop their second-round series against Detroit, ending their bid for a third straight NBA Finals appearance. April 26, 2002 Kerry Kittles hits a 3-pointer with 22.5 seconds remaining to lift the Nets to an 85-84 Game 3 win in the first round of the playoffs against Indiana. Jason Kidd scored 24 points with 11 assists and Kenyon Martin had 21 points. The Nets entered the 2002 NBA Playoffs as the Eastern Conference\u2019s top seed, but carrying the burden of a checkered NBA history with just one playoff series win in their first 25 seasons. They would go on to reach two straight NBA Finals, but the toughest challenge they would face in the Eastern Conference over those two seasons was the first one, against a veteran Indiana team that had gone to the Finals itself two years earlier. They eventually triumphed with a double-overtime win in the decisive Game 5. Share Links: "}

As has been the trend since the beginning of the James Borrego era, Martin\u2019s 28 G League outings this season played a significant role in the rapid development of the 24-year-old\u2019s game. Martin had entered just five regular season NBA games prior to Feb. 8, all of which came in contests where the outcome was already decided. Spending most of his time shuttling back and forth between Greensboro instead, the North Carolina native averaged 21.4 PPG on 46.8% shooting (36.3% from distance), 6.1 RPG, 3.7 APG and 1.6 SPG for the Swarm this season. \u201cWhen we first started in Greensboro, we were all just out of college and it was really fast-paced,\u201d said Martin on March 11 in Miami. \u201cGuys are a little wild and out of control, including myself.

Usage rate measures the amount of offensive team plays used/ended by a player while he\u2019s on the floor, whether it\u2019s via a shot (made or missed), turnover or free throw(s). In his past 13 NBA games, Martin has averaged 7.8 PPG on 45.9% shooting (a fiery 58.8% from three), 2.5 RPG and 1.5 APG, which included a career-high 23 and 19-point showings across a two-game road trip from March 9-11. He ranks fifth overall in scoring amongst undrafted rookies with at least 15 appearances this season and no prior professional experience (6.2 PPG). Where Martin is excelling specifically on offense is in catch-and-shoot situations, which has provided the Hornets little drop-off in an area that now-Milwaukee Buck Marvin Williams specialized at for years. At the moment, Martin leads all NBA players in catch-and-shoot three-point percentage with at least 1.5 such attempts per game (63.3%). Per CleaningtheGlass.com, Martin is also in the 85th\u00a0percentile for wings in block percentage (1.2%), 81st\u00a0in steal percentage (1.8%) and 94th\u00a0percentile in effective field-goal percentage (59.9%). His usage rate is down to just 15.2% at the NBA level, freeing him up to focus on a few areas in particular without being stretched too thin on both sides of the court. \u201cI\u2019m finding ways to maneuver through the offense, finding baskets here and there. It\u2019s not as high of a rate [at the NBA level] because we already have guys that do that, so I want to use a lot of my energy playing defense, picking up full court and bringing energy. But now, I\u2019m figuring out the best of both worlds and getting some offense in there when I can.\u201d With over 1,000 minutes of G League play under his belt, Martin had plenty of synchronized in-game repetitions with the Swarm before moving into the Hornets\u2019 rotation in mid-February. \u201cWhen you keep going over and over the same type of situation, things will get stuck in your mind,\u201d Martin said. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to carry over things from the G League to the actual NBA game. A lot of things are pretty similar. The only difference is players. Some guys are better, some guys are more athletic, but at the end of the day, you can still carry over the same concepts.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll say this about the G League in general \u2013 guys are talented,\u201d said Hornets guard Joe Chealey, who played with Martin in both Greensboro and Charlotte this season. \u201cThey\u2019re NBA-caliber dudes down there and there was never a doubt in my mind that Caleb was at that level, too. When you know, you know and it\u2019s just a matter of things working out. That\u2019s the nature of the league sometimes and when you get the opportunity, try to take advantage of it.\u201d Spot shooting, athleticism, size (6\u20195\u201d and 205 lbs) and advanced instincts have Martin pointed in the right direction with finishing at the rim (just 40%) the most glaring part of his game he\u2019ll need to address. He is the only current Hornet with a positive net rating (0.8) and isn\u2019t showing any signs of contentment despite how far he\u2019s come in such a short amount of time. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever get satisfied or think that you\u2019re entitled to any minutes or play,\u201d Martin stated. \u201cAt the end of the day, you still have to earn every second that you\u2019re out there. I just want to go out there and make an impact every chance I get and it\u2019s going to start with the defensive end. Whether I\u2019m younger or older, I just want to impact the game in order to solidify myself on the court no matter what.\u201d "}

Hope everybody is doing well and staying safe out there. I\u2019ll admit, things have been pretty hard not being able to play basketball or play games. I have my sister Andrea and my brother Juancho here with me and we\u2019re all living together in the same building for the first time in six or seven years. It\u2019s something we\u2019re enjoying. We wake up early in the morning, have breakfast together and work out together, too. My sister is doing online classes. We generally have lunch together with my family over a Zoom call. I talk with them and see how my parents are doing back in Spain. I just try and support them because the situation is very bad in Spain, too. I only see my brother and sister a couple of times a year and we only really spend time together in the summer unless we have National Team stuff or whatever. Having them here is something special. We\u2019re using this time to be together, do things together. For my parents, us being together here in Charlotte is something good and makes them feel like we\u2019re all safe. We haven\u2019t killed each other yet, but sometimes it\u2019s close! It\u2019s been pretty fun. We have a great relationship and it\u2019s helped pass the time while we stay safe. I try to talk to my friends and family in Spain at least once a day. Back in Spain, it\u2019s getting better day by day. They\u2019ve already been in quarantine for almost two months without going outside their homes. The police and army are patrolling the streets trying to take care of everything. The situation was very serious there, but hopefully getting better every single day. The government is saying maybe in a couple weeks the kids will be allowed to go outside with their parents to go to the supermarket and back or whatever. Hopefully, it doesn\u2019t get nearly as bad here. That\u2019s why I want to tell everybody to take this seriously. If you watch the news over in Europe, a lot of people are sick. You see it here already in New York and the big cities. It\u2019s something if we work together, we can beat it. My siblings and I spend the time playing Fortnite together, video games, reading. I\u2019m staying busy by continuing my studies. I\u2019m learning about Management of Sports Centers. I was doing that step by step during the season, but now I have an opportunity to really move a step forward. I try to spend at least one, maybe two hours every day working on it. Studying, doing online exams through the website from Spain. I\u2019m also making Tik Toks with my sister and my brother, which I know you guys have been seeing! We try to cook sometimes. My sister cooks really, really well. We\u2019ve tried to do a Spanish omelet and stuff like that.  By Joe Chealey It\u2019s crazy to think it\u2019s been four weeks since our last game. It was a bit weird because we were coming off a high going into the locker room in Miami. It was a big win, a big performance and then we heard the news. That kind of took away from the win a little bit in my opinion and dampened the mood. Guys were concerned and stuff like that before finding out what was going on. Looking back in hindsight, it\u2019s crazy how everything unfolded. I actually tore my Achilles\u2019 tendon back in college, so I\u2019ve known what it\u2019s like to have basketball taken away at a moment\u2019s notice. Obviously, this situation is much different, but I already had a sense of appreciation. Nothing in life is guaranteed. With basketball, that\u2019s why you treat each game like it\u2019s your last because you never really know when something can be taken away from you. This pandemic has reemphasized how quickly things can change and made me appreciate basketball even more than I did before. I was on my second 10-day contract when the season got suspended and with player movement also paused, it\u2019s uncharted territory for sure. While everything was unfolding the first couple of weeks, there were a lot of talks going on about how things were going to go because nothing like this has ever happened \u2013 in my situation specifically. Ultimately, I\u2019m still part of the team and I\u2019ve approached it that way. Coaches, the staff and everybody else has treated me as such. They\u2019re still checking on me and I\u2019m still working out and communicating. I don\u2019t know how things will play out with the season, but I am grateful for any opportunity to be with this organization. Obviously, not under these circumstances we\u2019re seeing, but it\u2019s a blessing to be communicating with those guys on a daily basis and to continue to be a part of the team. I\u2019ve been working out for sure. I\u2019ve been trying to do something daily, but that only takes up a small portion of the day. The rest of it is catching up on shows, reading some books, other interests. It takes you back to being a kid. You have to be creative and find a way to stay active and engaged. Been playing video games, too. Just trying to make the time go by. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of 2K and been watching that crazy new show on Netflix called Tiger King, which is entertaining for sure.  By Bismack Biyombo It\u2019s been three weeks since our last game and at first, I thought we were going to be back quicker. We were just coming off a win in Miami and people were saying you have to be quarantined for 14 days and then we\u2019re going to get back to what we love. From there as we all gathered more information, took some time and heard from the medical experts, we took a step back and looked at the big picture. Instead of 14 days, this is going to take a bit longer. Then you have to start preparing for it mentally. As one of the VP\u2019s of the Players\u2019 Association, I think there\u2019s an increased responsibility with what we\u2019re currently facing. We\u2019re probably spending more time on phone calls then we have in the past. Catching up with people, discussing what could be good for the league \u2013 we\u2019re all kind of focusing to see how we can work together and have a healthy environment so we can play again. We have to look at things from a business side and at a personal level. How can I make things better and how can I better myself and help others? We\u2019re also looking at what\u2019s going on back home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The virus hasn\u2019t hit us badly yet, but we\u2019re working to see how the government is going to respond. We\u2019re not well-equipped medically as it is. The last information I got was a little over a week ago before they started shutting things down. We\u2019ve been having conversations and going back and forth reaching out to people. In a bit, I might have more information about how my foundation is able to help. Right now, I try to go to bed at my regular time and get up early in the morning. Usually, I get up at about 7:30 AM, but now I\u2019m pushing that to sometimes 8 AM, sometimes 9 AM. I get up, do my workout, read and then start sending some emails out. Then, I\u2019ll make some phone calls, have lunch, do more calls, spend some time with my family and watch TV. I love watching the shows about cartels. Once it hits like 5 or 6 PM, I try and do some more reading. Every now and then during the week, I try and go for a swim. Thankfully, I have a pool where I can go and enjoy the weather. Everything has been quite interesting lately because you don\u2019t usually have this much time away from basketball. The only other time I spent this much time at home was in 2016 after my one season with Toronto. We played in the Eastern Conference Finals and I think I played around 112 total games, counting preseason and postseason. I played every game and my body was just hurting. I\u2019d wake up, eat, read and then go back to sleep over and over again! I did that for about a week. My family is here and able to be around to share conversations, stories and memories with. For me, I\u2019m still enjoying things. What we\u2019re going through right now isn\u2019t usual, but at the same time, you\u2019re either going to let it bring you down or you\u2019re going to get the best out of it. I\u2019m enjoying the process of getting better every day, staying in shape, staying healthy and making sure we\u2019re taking care of our families. That\u2019s the most important thing. At the end of the day, it\u2019s nice to play basketball, but it\u2019s also nice to be healthy and live a long life.  By Jalen McDaniels Hope everyone is staying safe out there \u2013 it\u2019s been a crazy two weeks! Before the season got suspended, I felt like as a team, we were starting to make a little bit of a climb. Overall, we were just getting better together. After that comeback win in Miami, everybody was disappointed that we weren\u2019t going to be playing and didn\u2019t know how long we weren\u2019t going to be playing for either. I feel like everybody\u2019s really excited to get the season going again, whenever that time comes. Right now, there isn\u2019t any basketball and it makes you think like, \u201cWow, it could be gone at any second and this is an example of it.\u201d It feels like your dream is on hold right now. Everybody wants to play and it definitely gives me a new-found appreciation for what we\u2019re able to do as basketball players. These last few weeks, I\u2019ve really just been staying at home doing in-home workouts. I got a few weights brought in and some other equipment at my house. Other than that, I\u2019m really just chilling. Catching up on shows, sleep, not doing too much. I\u2019m watching All American right now, which is the show I\u2019ve been watching the most I\u2019d say. I\u2019ve got a lot of friends around the league, so I talk to them on Xbox on the daily. Also, hitting up my Hornets teammates as well. Everybody\u2019s feeling the same way, but yeah, that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019ve been communicating. Just playing Xbox together and keeping in touch for sure. I talk to my brother, Jaden, every day. He just had his freshman season at the University of Washington cut short as well. We\u2019re doing a lot of FaceTime and I\u2019m going to try and get out there soon whenever this current situation blows over, hopefully. Looking back at my first NBA season, I wanted to show that I can play in the NBA and stick in the league with what I can bring to a team. I feel like me showing what I can do every game, every practice and that I can be consistent helped me establish a role. That gives me more leeway with the coaches and now, I can do more things to show off my game as time goes on. I feel like I\u2019m doing a good job of doing what I\u2019m doing and doing the things I do best.  By Devonte Graham After sitting out one game in Indiana a couple weeks ago, I feel like I\u2019m back to my old self. It\u2019s a long season. You\u2019re going to have some of those times where you just need to refresh and stuff like that. I think it was good for me and I\u2019ve come back and been playing well. Terry has also got it going lately! Together, we\u2019re the engine of the team, so when we come out and play well, it trickles down to our teammates. Coach always says we can take the team as far as we want to go. We\u2019re just trying to come out, be aggressive, do what we do and it\u2019s been working. Over our last seven games, six of them have pretty much come down to the wire. We love playing in games like that. We feel really confident. We draw up plays in the huddle and things like that, then come out and execute them. Lately, Coach has been telling us we\u2019ve been one of the top teams in the league in executing in late-game situations or after timeouts. We definitely love being in those moments and trying to come out with those wins. Our bench play lately has been huge. I tell our guys like Caleb, Cody and Jalen they just have to be aggressive and they\u2019ve been doing it. I feel like once they got comfortable and figured out like, \u2018Okay, I can do this. I can score, I can defend,\u2019 they\u2019ve just been playing really well. They always play with energy and just come in and do their job no matter what they\u2019re asked to do. They don\u2019t try and do too much. You know what you\u2019re going to get from those young guys off the bench and we love it. The NCAA Tournament is coming up and you know I got to say nobody\u2019s going to beat Kansas! You never know though because the tournament is always crazy. I\u2019m excited and definitely pulling for my guys and we\u2019ll see what happens. I don\u2019t have any superstitions, but I definitely get a lot more nervous watching then I did when I was in college playing for some strange reason. I love watching the games and I\u2019m right there cheering them on like I\u2019m sitting at the game as a fan.  By Joe Chealey I just signed another 10-day contract with the Hornets! I\u2019m extremely grateful to the organization, coaches and everybody involved. I\u2019m just trying to stay ready when my number is called. It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity and I\u2019m glad to be a part of it. When I heard about the first 10-day contract a couple weeks ago, we were about to practice in Greensboro. It was probably an hour before and I had just finished getting shots up. Cam Twiss, our General Manager in Greensboro, handed me a phone and it was my agent trying to get a hold of me. He told me I got the 10-day deal. It was surreal. You get caught up in the day-to-day grind and focusing on what you\u2019ve got to do, but I took a step back and realized I\u2019ve got a chance to be around guys at the highest level of basketball. It\u2019s a blessing and I\u2019m trying to soak up every moment of it. There were some guys around the league that reached to me, especially my family. They had a chance to come up to one of the home games last week, which was really cool. It\u2019s always been love. You can\u2019t get to this spot by yourself. It\u2019s a collection of people that have helped you along the way. I\u2019m trying not to make it about me. It\u2019s really about everyone else. Having been in the organization since the start of last season, they try to keep things consistent from up top in Charlotte down to Greensboro. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with the coaches whether it be at Summer League or training camp both times. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the system, the guys, personnel, all that kind of stuff. I\u2019m trying to make it as seamless a transition as possible. It\u2019s dope playing with a lot of my former Greensboro teammates right now. There was a moment in Indiana last week where Cody, Caleb, Jalen and I all had a chance to be on the court together. It was fun. We weren\u2019t winning, but just trying to play hard and keep things in perspective. It\u2019s been a journey for those guys and myself. It\u2019s a testament to their hard work and the organization for giving us the opportunity. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic now playing with a lot of the rookie guys who started the season in Greensboro. I guess technically I\u2019ve been with the organization a little bit longer. We help each other out. I know how things kind of work at the NBA and in the league, the lifestyle. Obviously, they know a little bit more about the NBA game because they have more experience. It\u2019s a good relationship. Even though I\u2019m not playing a lot, I still have to contribute. I try to be the ultimate team guy, the ultimate teammate. I try to add energy, bring life and have an impact in whatever role or facet that is whether it\u2019s cheering on the bench or talking to a guy at a timeout. I\u2019m just trying to help out any way I can.  By Jalen McDaniels After spending most of the first half of the season in Greensboro, I\u2019ve been with the Hornets for the past few weeks. I feel like the G League has prepared me for this time. When I go into the game, I know what I have to do \u2013 play defense, play with a high motor, hit opens shots, things I\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s really no difference between the G League and NBA in terms of what I\u2019m asked to do. You just have to lock in more on the defensive side and there\u2019s definitely more going on in the NBA game. When I look back to NBA Summer League in July, I was just a kid coming into this process, but now I feel like I\u2019ve matured. I know what to do on the court. I know what to work on. I go to the gym by myself. I\u2019m lifting and just getting more mature about being a professional. I\u2019ve been really working on my three-point shooting this season and I hit a few right before the All-Star Break in Detroit and Minnesota, which felt really good. I work on that all the time, so when I get open shots, they\u2019re supposed to go in. When they don\u2019t, I get mad about it! When I get those opportunities in the game, I\u2019m going to take them and make them. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m still going to keep shooting. The group we\u2019re playing with right now is definitely fun. It\u2019s a young group of guys just out there competing and having fun on the court. That\u2019s what we try and do. Just have fun and compete at the highest level. I feel like with those two things, if we do them, we can be pretty good in the future and even right now. I\u2019ve had my welcome-to-the-NBA moment recently and it was facing Brooklyn Nets center DeAndre Jordan. I got on him on a post-up and he\u2019s bigger than I thought he was. He\u2019s everything you see on TV. It\u2019s crazy! That was one moment, but nothing else so far really that\u2019s happened. I haven\u2019t gotten dunked on or blocked yet! I\u2019m waiting for it though. For the rest of the season, I just want to show that I can be an established player in this league. I want to showcase the abilities I have and show the coaches that I\u2019m the type of player we need on the court at all times. That\u2019s what I want to do. I want to be able to show I can play a lot of minutes and that I belong out there.  By Caleb Martin Hello Hornets fans! First blog of the season and I\u2019m excited about playing more recently. I feel good, I feel confident just knowing the coaches and our team is believing in me to jump in and start like I did last week in Minnesota. It just shows to me that they believe I can make an impact. I\u2019ve just been trying to use what I\u2019ve been doing in Greensboro and impact the team here at the NBA level. I was really excited and anxious when Coach Borrego told me I was going to start for the first time ever last Wednesday. I was grateful that he believes in me to take that spot when Terry was hurt. I did what I could and just brought a lot of energy. I also did a bunch of the little things to help us win, which we ended up doing! We recently lost a couple of veterans in Marvin and MKG. I got to know those guys while I was here and got really close with them. They helped my brother and I a lot and made the transition coming in as easy as possible. I hit them up and told them how grateful I was for how welcoming and helpful they were to Cody and I as rookies. For the young guys, this is our team, our core and we\u2019re moving with what we\u2019ve got right now. I\u2019m just looking forward to doing what I can and helping out the team any way possible. I think it\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s definitely been fun the last two games. My brother, Cody, has been sidelined with a concussion recently, but he\u2019s finally back at practice. I was talking to him the other day about how glad I was that the protocol was going away. He\u2019s starting to get on the court and move around and shoot. It\u2019s always fun playing with my brother and it\u2019ll be fun when he gets back. We went down to Florida for the All-Star Break, but still watched our guys in Chicago \u2013 we\u2019re proud of them! They represented us well. Miles won the Rising Stars Challenge MVP, Devonte\u2019 was in the 3-Point Contest and PJ was there as a rookie. It\u2019s pretty cool to see and makes you want to work that much harder to hopefully one time play in a setting like that. I think it\u2019s pretty cool how they represented our organization.  By Devonte\u2019 Graham What\u2019s going on Hornets fans??!?! Devonte\u2019 checking in after wrapping up my first NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. It was really exciting and I was glad to be there with my teammates Miles and PJ. We put in a lot of hard work to get here and just soaked it all in. As a second-round draft pick, I\u2019ve always had a little chip on my shoulder. Going against the guys who were drafted before you and the teams that overlooked you, it just puts that fire in you and makes you work harder. I\u2019ve got guys around me who love to work, too. That makes it a lot easier. We won the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday night and Miles got MVP! I feel like we all played well. The atmosphere was great and we had a little dunk show at the end. I give the experience a 10-out-of-10. You have to give some credit to our second unit. We came in, played out hearts out and came back to get the victory! I got to play against my former Kansas teammate Svi Mykhailiuk in the Rising Stars Challenge, too. Svi now plays for the Detroit Pistons, although there wasn\u2019t any smack talk or anything beforehand. We got to do a few media events together on Thursday, enjoyed the game, enjoyed each other. I did my best to iso on him during the game whenever he got on me. Lastly, I finished things off with the 3-Point Contest on Saturday night. I was definitely nervous. My first shot was an airball. That first rack \u2013 whew, but it was fun. It was a good experience and I enjoyed it. I started out slow, real slow, but once I got going, I was able to hit a couple and shake the nerves. I liked the new format with the really deep threes. Guys shoot that all the time now in games, so that was a good thing to put in. Of course, I would definitely do it again. I just enjoyed everything this weekend. Taking pictures, seeing all the guys, seeing former NBA players. The whole experience has been a blessing. Me, Miles and PJ had a lot of people supporting us, hitting us up on social media, stuff like that. It was definitely huge love. Now though, I\u2019m going to take my break and just chill, relax and go home to Charlotte!  By Malik Monk What\u2019s going on Hornets fan?!?! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already February \u2013 the season is moving quick. I just turned 22 and to celebrate, I\u2019ve been playing pretty well lately. More and more, I\u2019ve been thinking about what can help the team when Devonte\u2019 or Terry aren\u2019t scoring. Miles can\u2019t do everything, Cody can\u2019t do everything, so somebody else has to step up. I\u2019m coming off the bench and we need somebody to bring that energy. We need somebody with a lot of juice and I\u2019ve really just put it in my mind that it\u2019s going to be me. Even though I\u2019ve been playing well, we still haven\u2019t been winning as much as a team. I\u2019m in my third season and it\u2019s all about just sticking with it, not giving up and not hanging my head down. I can\u2019t let everyone else \u2013 especially the rookies \u2013 hang their heads, too. Marvin and the rest of the vets also do a great job of keeping everybody positive even when things are tough. I really don\u2019t have to do too much in that area, but I\u2019m still doing as much as I can. I just have to keep taking responsibility. Our last game in Houston, we played nothing but young guys. It seems like we\u2019re always in the game until the fourth quarter, even with some really good teams. That shows a lot just with us being young and having talent. After we get that together and get a couple more years under our belts, get out there and learn more about playing the game, I think we\u2019ll be alright. Last week, Devonte\u2019, PJ and Miles were all named to the Rising Stars Challenge on All-Star Weekend. I would go to watch, but I\u2019m sick of seeing them (just kidding!). I\u2019ll watch those guys on TV for sure and follow them on Twitter and Instagram throughout the weekend. All of them going just shows how big a foundation we\u2019re building. Three guys on one team at Rising Stars is something special. We\u2019ll have a little bit of time off with the All-Star Break, which will be a great opportunity to regroup. We have a little less than 30 games remaining once we get back. Our goal is to have a winning record during that stretch. I\u2019m going to go relax my mind and come back super-focused, so we try and win more than we lose the couple months.  By PJ Washington Hey, there Hornets fan! We are back from Paris and finally picked up a big home win last night against the Knicks. It had been awhile since we won, but we\u2019ve been fighting. Every game you have to come out with a certain mindset to win. No matter how many games you lose, you still have another game. You just come out and try and be aggressive each and every game and know in the back of your mind that if we lose this one, we still have another one the next day. Just come out and be aggressive no matter what. We only shot like 38% against New York. If you win a game like that, it\u2019s pretty hard to do. I think the little things are something we can work on every day and do every game. I feel like if we do those little things like rebounding and making free throws, it\u2019ll be that much easier for us to win because we\u2019re not going to always make shots. The last few days have been pretty emotional following Kobe Bryant\u2019s passing. He meant a lot to me growing up. He was definitely my favorite player \u2013 we both have the same birthday. I had his jersey, I played with him on the video games all the time, had his shoes and everything. As a kid growing up and looking up to him, he was definitely a big influence. He definitely helped me get here. Just to have that tragedy happen, it\u2019s just sad. I didn\u2019t believe it at first. I didn\u2019t want to believe it. Prayers out to everybody that was affected. At the end of the day, we all know that he would want us to go out there and play for him. We had a meeting after the accident and everybody just talked about how different Kobe was. Obviously, I never got a chance to play against him, but if I did, I think I would just be out there in awe seeing how good he was in person. The All-Star Break is coming up in a few weeks and they\u2019ll be announcing the Rising Stars rosters soon. It\u2019d mean a lot to get chosen because it\u2019d show how much work I\u2019ve put in and how dedicated I am. Regardless though, I feel like I have to keep pushing. There\u2019s a lot more I want to do in my career here in Charlotte. Just have to keep pushing.  By Marvin Williams Bonjour from Paris everybody! We got here Tuesday night and the flight was really good. Mostly everyone slept and I was kind of in and out myself. What was impressive was Miles slept literally the entire time! He was asleep before takeoff and asleep when we landed. It was unbelievable \u2013 eight-and-a-half hours straight. It was a good flight though. My family is also out here, which is great. They didn\u2019t travel with us. They got here a couple of days before, but they are here with us. I\u2019m looking forward to kind of running around with them for a little bit. My family and I love to travel. That\u2019s the one thing that we do. We try to go to as many places as we can. Definitely when the opportunity presented itself for us to come here, they jumped on it. They\u2019ve been here for a few more days than we have and they\u2019re having fun. It\u2019s been good trying to follow Nic around as much as possible. I\u2019ve just been trying to learn some things about Paris and about France. Overall, it\u2019s been great so far. He\u2019s showed me a couple of great restaurants that he likes. Hopefully if there\u2019s some free time, I can enjoy them. There\u2019s also a place nearby where I can take my kids and let them run around. It\u2019s somewhere where he takes his son every summer. He has given me some good advice so far. Obviously, I want to get out into Paris a little bit more and try the food, try the wine and see some things, but I\u2019ll definitely have more thoughts about everything when we leave here on Saturday. It was cool seeing the Eiffel Tower up close. I actually saw it Tuesday night from the plane. I was looking out the window and saw this huge light circling around and there it was. Seeing it in person and taking some pictures was really cool. We can\u2019t forget though that we are here to play a game tomorrow. After that long flight, it felt good to get moving again the morning after we landed. I got up and lifted. It felt pretty good to sweat a little bit, too. We didn\u2019t really do anything two days ago except sit on the plane. To be back in the gym, I know guys are happy about it and we can\u2019t wait to get out there and play Milwaukee.  By Willy Hernang\u00f3mez Hola Hornets fan! Time for my first blog of the season! We\u2019re closing out a four-game road trip tonight and last Friday, I got a big opportunity to play a lot in Utah and then again in Portland. It\u2019s been a really hard season for me, because I haven\u2019t been playing as much as I\u2019d like. I always try to be positive, work hard every day and support my teammates because they are all my family. I just try to be happy and I know at some point, I will have my opportunity. I just have to be ready. It was fun to be out there with my teammates, trying to play the right kind of basketball. I really enjoy playing with them. Hopefully we get a win soon, but it was amazing to finally get back out there and compete. I just love basketball. It\u2019s the way I live and basketball to me is amazing. It\u2019s been a big part of my family since I was young. I know I want to play games and even when I don\u2019t, I know the next day there\u2019s going to be a practice. I use every day as an opportunity to work, to get better, to learn from my coaches and teammates. Sometimes, you get frustrated because you lose or don\u2019t get much playing time. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve got another opportunity. I just try to have that mindset and treat each and every day as an opportunity. I enjoy the process. Next week, we\u2019re playing the Milwaukee Bucks in the first-ever regular season NBA game in Paris. It\u2019s going to be an amazing experience for all of us being in France. Obviously for European people, seeing an NBA game that close is going to also be an amazing experience. I think for all my teammates that have never been to Europe, it\u2019s going to be an opportunity to learn and see a different culture and country. I\u2019ll use Nico and he\u2019ll show us the city and give us the best restaurants ton eat at. Obviously, this is going to be a huge game for Nico and he\u2019s incredibly excited to be going to his home country. All his friends and family are going to be there. His whole country is going to support him. I\u2019m really excited for the game and to see him play. It\u2019s going to be an amazing environment, almost like a soccer environment with everybody yelling and supporting us. It\u2019s going to be a great game for the fans and they\u2019re going to really enjoy it. The last time I was in Paris was the European Championships in 2015 and we beat France in the semifinals, so I hope the fans don\u2019t remember that! And with playing the Nuggets tonight, I get another chance to see my brother, Juancho, who plays for the team. To have a brother in the NBA who came into the league the same year that you did is pretty incredibly. We\u2019re really supportive of each other. We talk every day and really lean on each other. I think more or less being in the same situation where we\u2019re both having to wait for our opportunity to play more, we try and give each other great advice. We both just have to be ready because you never know. Hopefully, he gets the opportunity to play today and we can play against each other. We always look forward to these games when the schedule comes out and its always special to play against him. Our family is all going to be watching the game from Spain, even though it\u2019s going to be 3 AM at home. They\u2019re going to be awake to watch, but once that ball is in the air, there\u2019s no more family, nothing. It\u2019s business. We\u2019ll try to win the game against Denver and go home with a victory.  By Jalen McDaniels Time for my first blog Hornets fans! My rookie season is almost halfway done and it\u2019s been going pretty well. I\u2019m developing every day, getting stronger, developing my game on the court. The year has been going by so fast. It\u2019s already January and we\u2019re halfway through the season! My goal is just to improve every day and every game. It\u2019s been great being a part of the Hornets organization. I feel like the coaches have been pushing me, wanting me to be a part of the team and be a better player. When I got drafted last summer, I knew I needed a lot of time to develop my game. It\u2019s about being more comfortable, more confident. By playing in the G League, I feel like I\u2019ve built up that confidence in order to play in the NBA game. My three-point shooting ability has improved the most this season. I\u2019m now at 41.5% after shooting 29.8% in college.  I\u2019m been much more consistent shooting this year and have also shown I can play multiple positions. I can have the ball in my hands, make plays off the ball, offensive rebounding \u2013 just playing with a motor. For the rest of the season, I want to keep working on getting stronger. I\u2019d like to spend as much time in the weight room as I can. I feel like I want to put on even more weight because that\u2019ll help me become even more effective. Coming into the NBA, my size was one thing I definitely needed to improve on. Guys in the NBA are big, so you have to get big to match them. Being strong and playing hard \u2013 I feel like that\u2019s what it all comes down to. Overall, I just want to become a better all-around player. I have a younger brother, Jaden, who is currently a freshman playing at the University of Washington. We\u2019re really close and talk almost every day. He might be coming to the NBA soon, too, but I just tell him to take things one game at a time. Go out there, play and have fun. Don\u2019t worry about the NBA. Things will take care of themselves. All you have to do is play and play hard. He hits me up asking how I\u2019m doing and stuff like that. On the Hornets team, we\u2019ve got guys from colleges like North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State and Louisville. But right now, my school San Diego State is 15-0, ranked #7 in the country and I love it! They\u2019re going to keep going. They play the right way, they play great defense and team ball. They\u2019re going to get to that #1 spot, hopefully! I\u2019m not going to do any trash-talking just yet. I\u2019ll just wait until the NCAA Tournament.  By Cody Martin Happy New Year, Hornets fan! It\u2019s crazy we\u2019re already 36 games into my rookie season. It\u2019s been going by really, really fast. I think the biggest thing is just trying to find some good routines on and off the court to allow me to play at the highest level that I can. We\u2019re not even halfway through our schedule and I\u2019ve already played my college season worth of games! The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned since entering the NBA is how to develop a next-play mentality. For myself, a lot of times I can linger on certain plays, certain games and think about how we lost or what I should have done. Obviously, that\u2019s what film sessions are for. I think the biggest thing for me is next play, next game mentality. I\u2019m learning a lot of that from the vets because they\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. They\u2019ve had a lot of games under their belt, so they\u2019re trying to teach me. You can\u2019t really focus on things that might hurt or sting in the moment. Just learn from it, keep pushing and get better from those mistakes. I\u2019ve been playing a lot more right now than when I started this season and it\u2019s been awesome. I\u2019m just trying to take advantage of the minutes given and trying to earn them every single time I\u2019m out there on the floor and every time I step into practice. Basically, just do my job to the best of my ability, go out there, play hard and do whatever the team needs me to do to help us win. Since I came back from the G League, my three-point shooting has gotten a bit better, although I still can\u2019t quite keep pace with Marvin. He\u2019s killing me after practice. I\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 Marv\u2019s one of the best shooters I\u2019ve been around. He doesn\u2019t miss on any catch-and-shoots. I\u2019m trying to learn a lot from him and get a lot of reps in. Being around Marv and those guys at the end of practice, I like to talk to them and learn about their mindsets when it comes to shooting. It\u2019s really helped me and also obviously going down to the G League to play. I played with a lot of confidence in Greensboro and had fun while I was there. My brother, Caleb, is currently with the Greensboro Swarm right now, but we talk almost every day. Sometimes, it\u2019s about basketball, brother stuff, little bit of everything. We just talk about everything on and off the court. We haven\u2019t really seen each other too much lately. I see what\u2019s going on with him about his games and vice versa. He checks in on us and watches the games and I do the same thing. It\u2019s just about taking care of business when you\u2019re out on the court and taking advantage of the time we\u2019re given. And with today being New Year\u2019s Day, my New Year\u2019s resolution is pretty simple. It\u2019s business as usual for me in 2020. Obviously, it\u2019s just about improving every single year, not only as a player, but as a person. Just trying to be better in all aspects of the game and life.  By Bismack Biyombo Hello there, Hornets fan!! This is my first blog of the season, and lately, we\u2019ve been playing pretty well! It has just been comfortable overall. My teammates have done an amazing job in finding me and being able to rely on me defensively as well. I think overall, we have this chemistry where there\u2019s no ego and everybody just wants to play to accomplish the same goal, which is winning a ball game. That\u2019s really, really exciting to see as we continue to grow. People had so low of expectations for the team and now, those expectations have turned around quick. For us, we always believed. I feel comfortable that Coach Borrego has put me in the right spot in order to be successful, so I\u2019m very thankful for that. When I first got traded back to Charlotte last summer, I came back every night to work on everything with Assistant Coach Nate Mitchell. We did things that I didn\u2019t even think I would need or use. When he was teaching me the Eurostep, I was like, \u2018Man, when am I ever going to use this?\u2019 But yet, it just happened a year later in a game and my manager texted me saying, \u2018Oh man you did the Eurostep! I remember you working on that with Nate.\u2019 I spoke to Nate about it and you just never know when you\u2019re going to use some things. At the same time, from the moment I came back here, we\u2019ve just believed in working and the process. I\u2019m thanking God for every moment and along the way, God has always been by my side. I\u2019m very blessed to be in this position. I used to be the youngest guy on the team and now I\u2019m one of the veterans. It\u2019s fun for me because now you get to understand the things you wished somebody would have led you with. Now that you\u2019re in a position to be part of the leadership, then you find better ways to communicate with the young guys while having fun at the same time. The game is fun itself. If you ask PJ, I joke with him before games, outside of games. Same with Devonte\u2019 and everybody else. When it comes to the game, we\u2019re all just out there having fun, grinding every possession and it\u2019s exciting. Outside of basketball, Christmas is coming up and I think it\u2019s going to be refreshing to be able to spend time with family. We get a chance to talk, laugh and enjoy a good meal. I\u2019m mostly excited about seeing everybody. When I first got drafted by Charlotte, I missed about five Christmas holidays because my family wasn\u2019t around. But now they\u2019re around and we can celebrate. It\u2019s going to be the third or fourth year we\u2019re all going to be together \u2013 my mom, my dad, my little sister. We\u2019re all excited to be together and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. For me when I was growing up, I left my family when I was pretty young to go play basketball. When you make it to this level, you have to rely on family so much to be able to disconnect, laugh, talk about things you can\u2019t talk to others about. I\u2019m really looking forward to it and it\u2019s a blessing to be able to share moments like that with family. I just have to thank God for it.  By Cody Zeller Hey there Hornets fans!!! This is my first blog of the season and we\u2019re now about 25 games into the schedule. I\u2019m one of the older guys now and I\u2019ve been trying to help the young guys along. They\u2019ve played well, especially guys like Devonte\u2019 and Miles has also been playing well lately. We\u2019ve had our growing pains, obviously. We\u2019ve lost a few close games, gotten blown out a few times and had a few times where we\u2019ve let late leads slip away. That\u2019s just a part of being young. It\u2019s tough to play well in this league every night. It\u2019s a long season even for veterans like me, but I think the young guys have handled it pretty well so far. As one of the more experienced guys on the team, it\u2019s been really fun to see the young players do well. It\u2019s cool to see them develop. We didn\u2019t really know what to expect from them going into the season, but you obviously see how hard they work in the summer and you hope that they have a good year. Devonte\u2019 and PJ, especially have had a great year to start with and hopefully, they can keep it up. Off the court right now, it is the holiday season and it\u2019s super important to me to give back to the community, whether it\u2019s with the Hanes Sock Drive or visiting the Novant Children\u2019s Hospital. The longer I\u2019m here in Charlotte, the more it feels like home to me, so I want to give back and impact however I can. I take the time any time an opportunity comes forward and it\u2019s something I can help with. We\u2019ve got four days off over Christmas this year and my family is going to be visiting me this year! My brother, Tyler, is in Chapel Hill and my other brother, Luke, and my parents are back in Indiana. They\u2019re going to come down here for what I think is the best Christmas schedule we\u2019ve had since I got here. It\u2019ll be nice to have a couple of days together. Even today, it\u2019s still my family\u2019s Christmas tradition to go to church on Christmas Eve and then open all of our gifts that night (Santa comes while we\u2019re at church!). When we were younger, we\u2019d sleep in and then play with our toys or whatever on Christmas Day. It\u2019s always fun just to be together and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Luke has a six-year-old and Tyler has a two-and-a-half-year-old and one on the way, so, I have fun being the uncle they beat up on. I spoil them like crazy!  By Terry Rozier What\u2019s happening Hornets fan?! We are glad to be back in Charlotte for our five-game homestand. Lately, we\u2019ve had a lot of close games and those are definitely ones I love to be in! Most people that play this game, we all love that type of atmosphere. That\u2019s something we can ask for, but this year has been crazy on both ends, whether we\u2019re losing or winning. Especially coming down to the last shot, we\u2019ve been in a lot of crazy games like that. It\u2019s competitive and we all enjoy it. On defense, I just try and be active everywhere. Trying not to let my man score, trying to play help defense with my teammates. I love going for loose balls and grabbing rebounds, things like that. It just shows toughness. I like getting in there and just scrapping with the big guys. I\u2019m just super competitive. I want to win on both ends of the floor. I\u2019m all about being scrappy and I love to score. The city of Charlotte has been very welcoming. It\u2019s so laidback. It\u2019s very chill. People don\u2019t do too much. They mind their own business, but at the same time, they show me love. That\u2019s always great and something you love to have. It\u2019s never too much, never too little. I\u2019m settling in very well and the fans here are great. I just appreciate everything you do and cheering us on every night. Off the court, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m pretty boring! I don\u2019t really do too much. I like movies and shopping. I chill at the house with my peoples. I might do something here or there, but it\u2019s never anything too crazy. I know I\u2019m pretty boring, but summertime, that\u2019s when I\u2019m active! Restaurants though, I like Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House around by my house. I\u2019ve got a chef, but I\u2019m looking forward to finding new spots. I like trying new stuff and with time, I\u2019ll get around to more.  By Marvin Williams Hey there Hornets fans and Happy Thanksgiving! Hope everybody is doing well. We\u2019re a little over a month into the season and we\u2019ve hit a little bit of adversity, which happens. Throughout the course of a season, you\u2019re going to have some highs when you win a few in a row and some lows when you lose a few in a row. I think the biggest thing for us is to stay positive and keep working. I feel like we had a great practice yesterday. JB has done a great job of really coaching us, pushing us and encouraging us all at the same time. He\u2019s found a great balance with that. I think the morale and all is pretty good. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a couple of heart-breakers lately and it has been difficult, but at the end of the day, I think we\u2019re all still in a really good place and really excited to play tonight. I think the biggest thing you can take away from the games we have lost (outside of that crazy Chicago game) is that we\u2019ve had a lot of great stretches of play. At Washington, we were up nine or ten points in the fourth quarter and then lost tough one right there. Lost a tough one to Chicago. There were a lot of things in the Miami game we could have cleaned up. The things we\u2019re making mistakes on are definitely controllable. I think that\u2019s the most encouraging thing. We\u2019re learning, still growing every day and trying to get better and better. As the season continues to progress, we\u2019ll continue to get better and become more consistent on the defensive end. We\u2019ll keep playing together on the offensive end and hopefully some of these heart-breaking losses will start turning into big wins for us. We\u2019re taking on the Pistons tonight and then again on Friday up in Detroit. We\u2019ve played really well against them the last year or so. They\u2019re so well coached and they have such good players that they force you to play at a high level. Whenever we play those guys, we know if we\u2019re not bringing our A-game, they\u2019re going to run us out of the gym. They\u2019ll beat you up physically on the inside and they have a lot of guys who can make shots on the outside. You really have to be locked in when you play those guys. We\u2019ve done well against them in the past, so hopefully we can come out tonight and play with the same intensity and effort that we\u2019ve played with the last time we played them. With tomorrow being Thanksgiving, we\u2019ll have a solid day or so to spend with family before flying out in the evening. We\u2019ve been gone for so much lately and it is a little difficult for guys who have families and kids, but that is the NBA. It\u2019s what we signed up for, but it will be kind of nice to have an opportunity to have a morning with my family and an early evening as well. That\u2019ll be fun and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to it. Any time you get to be around for a holiday or a birthday, it is something you always do appreciate. I know with the NBA schedule (like Christmas for example), there are going to be a lot of teams that are on the road on Christmas Day. I\u2019m sure that is tough for guys who have families or whatever the case may be, but I\u2019m really thankful to have the opportunity to wake up here tomorrow morning and spend a little bit of time with family before we have to take off. And lastly, I have to admit I don\u2019t really have a favorite Thanksgiving dish! Over the years, I\u2019ve missed so many of them with my family because of the NBA schedule that it\u2019s almost kind of just another day. It\u2019s always great to get together with family and friends and eat. The camaraderie is what makes it so special. I\u2019m just looking forward to seeing everybody, definitely.  By Devonte\u2019 Graham How\u2019s it going, Hornets fans? We\u2019re halfway through our road trip and looking to pick up another couple of wins before coming back home to Charlotte. Looking back, hitting that last-second shot against the Knicks on Saturday night was a great feeling. It was a great team win. Madison Square Garden is a tough place to play. Fans are loud and pack it in there every night. Any road win though is just a good team win. Having so many guys contribute in crunch-time moments this season has been great. Since the beginning of the season, we haven\u2019t had just one guy that goes out and is our main scorer every night. We have to bank on each other. One night it can be me, one night it can be Terry, one night it can be Bake, one night it can be Miles, Malik or whatever the case may be. We just have to make sure we\u2019re prepared, ride the hot hand and keep playing through any adversity. It\u2019s still very early in the season, but it\u2019s still pretty crazy I\u2019m currently second in the NBA in total three-point fields. I never would have imagined that! It\u2019s not something I really would have even thought about. The way games have been going, I just have to keep playing with that confidence and keep shooting the ball. My teammates keep telling me to shoot the ball, so that\u2019s what I go out and try and do. We\u2019re coming off a tough loss in Toronto, where we didn\u2019t play very well as a team. We had a good practice yesterday, watched film and got better. You can always learn and get better from losses like that. You have to put games like that behind you. You can\u2019t be too high or too low. We had those two back-to-back game-winners, but we can\u2019t live on that forever. We have to move on and Toronto came out and smacked us in the mouth. Now, we\u2019re just prepared for tonight. Lastly, I got to hang out with one of my good friends, Theo Pinson, last night, who plays guard for the Brooklyn Nets. I was watching my Kansas Jayhawks pull out a close win and he was making jokes. That game got ugly there for a little bit, when the other guys started coming back! East Tennessee State was down by just five with five minutes to go, but we were all good!  By Terry Rozier How\u2019s it going Hornets fan?!?! It\u2019s great to be in Charlotte and I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re already three weeks into the season! Being a new guy, it\u2019s been a bit of an adjustment. I\u2019m slowly making things happen, learning my teammates, learning how guys work. We\u2019re just 10 games in and I only feel like it\u2019s going to get better from here. It\u2019s a long season and I\u2019m just going to keep trying to be a leader and an outlet for these guys if they need help. We talked a lot in the preseason about how we want to play and so far, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of following through with it. It\u2019s been really good. We\u2019ve got a young, competitive group of guys that want to win. It\u2019s just been good for us to see the progress we\u2019ve been making. We know we have a lot of room for improvement and you know we\u2019re just going to keep getting better. We know that and it starts in practice with just pushing each other every day. Even though I\u2019m the new guy, I feel like I fit in pretty quickly. I\u2019m just trying to play ball, be competitive and definitely stay out of foul trouble. That\u2019ll help me a lot! Other than that, I\u2019m just going to keep trying to get better and these guys are great teammates better with. They make me comfortable every day. I love all my teammates, but one that stands out in particular is Marvin. He\u2019s one of a kind, a true veteran. He\u2019s very helpful with the team. He makes sure everybody is on the same page and things like that. He\u2019s definitely made my job a little easier since coming here. It\u2019s huge having a guy like him. He\u2019s been around the game for a long time. Been to the playoffs plenty of times and he knows how this game works inside and out, off the court and on the court. He\u2019s just a huge help for the guys and I\u2019m glad to have him. We\u2019re starting a two-game homestand tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies and we\u2019re all ready to be in front of our Charlotte fans! We lost our last two here, so we\u2019re ready to get one back and get this thing rolling starting tonight.  By Devonte\u2019 Graham What\u2019s up, Hornets fans!?!?! We\u2019re coming off that big overtime victory over Indiana last night and I\u2019m definitely a little tired. My legs aren\u2019t used to playing 40 minutes in the NBA!! Definitely a little tired, but I\u2019m going to get some recovery work done and get some good stretching in. It was a huge win for the team. We fought back and showed that fight in us. I feel like in every game, we\u2019re getting better and better. The chemistry is getting there. I was happy and excited about the win, as I\u2019m sure everyone else was. Individually, I definitely couldn\u2019t have asked for a better start to the season. I didn\u2019t know what to expect with the new role I was going to have this year. Like I\u2019ve been saying, my coaches and teammates are giving me that confidence to keep going out there, shoot and stay aggressive. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. We started out slow last night, so I tried to come in and be that spark off the bench \u2013 get guys going and talking, attack the basket, knock down those shots when guys find me open. I was trying to do those little things to help us get on a run. We got the crowd into it, because that helps us and gives us more energy. Last night, we rolled with it and just kept going. One thing about us is that it\u2019s not just one person that opposing teams have to lock in on. On any given night, it could be anyone of us. Like the other night in Golden State, it was Bacon. The night before that it was PJ and Terry. We\u2019re just rolling off each other right now. Coach Borrego keeps telling us he has to find five guys who play well together. Each day, he\u2019s going to roll with the group that\u2019s going to bring the energy. Terry and I playing together, I definitely like it a lot. He can play off the ball, I can play off the ball. I think it\u2019s harder for teams to guard two point guards as easily \u2013 we have two guys that can make plays. It\u2019s great that things are starting to come together for us. It shows that the work we\u2019ve been putting in and the different pieces we have are paying off. We went through training camp and worked on building chemistry each practice. We keep getting better and better every day, every practice and every game. It\u2019s working out so far. Lastly, we\u2019re taking on the Boston Celtics tomorrow night and that means Kemba Walker is coming back. We still talk in a group chat. We\u2019ve been texting and he\u2019s been telling us \u2018Good game,\u2019 and stuff like that. We had dinner with him when we went to Boston in the preseason. We definitely have to try and beat him though! Can\u2019t let him come in here and put up 60 on us like we saw him do last year! It should be fun though and I\u2019m looking forward to it. 191030_playersblog.jpg  By Dwayne Bacon We\u2019re officially a week into the season! I feel like I\u2019m doing pretty well defensively right now, but offensively, it\u2019s not exactly where I want to be. There\u2019s no rush though \u2013 it\u2019s four games in and there\u2019s 78 games left. That\u2019s a long season and I feel like things will come. I just need to keep working and trust the work I\u2019ve put in all summer. Our guys are really buying into what we\u2019re trying to do this season. We played two of the best teams in the league already with the Lakers and the Clippers and we fought. Out of those eight quarters we played, we were right there in six of them. Guys aren\u2019t satisfied though. We just have to amp it up and finish games, but we feel like we\u2019re playing well and only going to get better. We\u2019re a young team with a lot of young guys and we trust each other. Pretty soon, we should be getting more wins just by doing what we\u2019ve been doing, trusting ourselves and playing hard. This is pretty early to have a West Coast road trip. It\u2019s a tough test for us, but we feel like we\u2019re holding our own. We didn\u2019t get the wins that we could have gotten \u2013 it just came down to the fourth quarter in both games in Los Angeles. We just have to build on it. There were a lot of good things in those games. We have to come out here tonight in Sacramento, get out in transition, run, get stops and continue to play through everything. We have in our head we can beat anybody on any night. Within us, we know what we can do. We know each other and a lot of us have been working and playing together in Charlotte all summer. We\u2019re comfortable with each other and now, trying to get everything locked in. We had some great games that we didn\u2019t win, but that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be this season for us. There\u2019s going to be more games where we play great and get the W. We just have to learn how to finish and we\u2019re going to keep competing all year. If we do that, we\u2019ll get W\u2019s just like we did the first game against Chicago. We just have to translate that to the rest of the season. It\u2019s definitely fun getting contributions from everybody right now. As the season goes on, we\u2019re probably going to need that all year. Guys know that we don\u2019t have the same players that we had last year, so we just have to come out and keep competing and do what we can do to get wins. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Lastly, I got to give a quick shoutout to a couple of my former Florida State teammates, Terance Mann and Mfiondu Kabengele, who we played against on Monday night when we faced the Clippers. Those guys are great. Fi\u2019 went from redshirting to a first-round pick and that\u2019s amazing to see him get drafted. I came into Florida State with T and we were teammates (and roommates) for two years. That\u2019s one of my best friends for sure. It\u2019s amazing to see the guys you grow with through college and now see them in the NBA. It\u2019s crazy. The Florida State alums in the NBA are growing every year and I think there\u2019s only going to be more moving forward! "}
{"team": "hornets", "url": "https://www.nba.com/hornets/borrego-touches-nba-hiatus-team-evaluation-player-engagement-and-more", "date": "2020-04-22 00:00:00", "tags": ["Hornets", "Sam Perley", "COVID-19"], "article": " It\u2019s been exactly six weeks since the Charlotte Hornets stepped off the floor at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami and into uncharted territory with the indefinite suspension of the NBA season in lieu of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s a new experience for everyone involved, but Head Coach James Borrego is making the most of the unexpected hiatus. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be more season to be played. We could be in offseason mode right now,\u201d said Borrego in a Wednesday morning conference call. \u201cWhat I can control is figuring out what we looked like this season. Where is our team headed? Really reflecting on what we looked like this season, where do our players need to get better, how did our player development program respond this year and then from there, what\u2019s our next step? So, whether we continue this season or we\u2019re into offseason mode, we\u2019re ready to go with a plan for each player in our development program.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m challenging them mentally right now and giving them some things to watch. Their bodies are a different thing. I don\u2019t really have a lot of control in that area right now. We\u2019re trying to keep them engaged physically, but a lot of these guys are limited. They don\u2019t have access to a ton of equipment. They don\u2019t have a court, a hoop. More than anything, a lot of players right now feel isolated just like many people throughout this world. It\u2019s my job as the head coach and the leader of this team to engage with them, talk with them, make sure they have what they need. If I feel somebody is disconnected, it\u2019s my job to reach out to them.\u201d Across the eight games heading into the league\u2019s suspension on March 11, the Hornets ranked 10th in the NBA in offensive rating (112.7) and 11th in defensive rating (111.0). They went 4-4 during this stretch, which included wins over Toronto, Houston and Miami and single-digit losses to Milwaukee, San Antonio and Denver. \u201cI\u2019ve really studied these last eight games,\u201d Borrego explained. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we saw a lot of growth and development. When we get back, we need to hit the ground running. We need to get back to playing that type of basketball. We were defending, we were moving the ball, we were athletic, we were attacking the rim. We cleaned up the turnover game a lot. I think we really held our own. The future is extremely bright with these guys. I think the more I watch those eight games, the more excited I get about our team and the leap they made throughout the season.\u201d Utilizing a rotation consisting primarily of younger players after the All-Star Break, Borrego praised President of Basketball Operations and GM Mitch Kupchak and the team\u2019s scouting department for his work in pinpointing the right pieces for the roster over the last two years. \u201cThe character piece is significant for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve had success. These kids we\u2019re bringing in are built with the right fiber, the right DNA. They\u2019re receptive to getting better and they fit our player development. Devonte\u2019, Miles, PJ, the Martin twins, Jalen \u2013 these are guys that are extremely coachable and very receptive.\u201d Borrego did admit there\u2019s only so much individual and team evaluating that he and the staff can do, and at the moment, he\u2019s begun identifying how the draft and free agency (whenever they take place) could address the team\u2019s most pressing needs. \u201cRim protection is something we\u2019re looking for. To be a top-level defense in today\u2019s league, you need to have some length and athleticism out there. I do think we\u2019re getting longer on the perimeter, and have some more size and athleticism. We\u2019re looking for another playmaker, a guy that can create for himself and create for others. I think the third piece is just shooting. In our system, we can never have enough shooting. That makes the game easier for everybody when you can space the floor and allow the athletic wings and bigs to attack the rim.\u201d \u201cWe have started the process of looking at free agency and the draft. I don\u2019t watch a ton of college or international basketball during the season, so it\u2019s been fun to take a step back and watch a few of these young kids. We\u2019ll have a very good first-round pick, and we\u2019re slotted for an early second-round pick. These are valuable pieces and this is where we turn our franchise. As we study ourselves and the NBA, I can go back and look at some of these upcoming free agents, and at the right time, sit down with Mitch and talk through the draft and free agency. We\u2019ll be able to pull some of the players who fit our system long term.\u201d Like much of the rest of society, Borrego doesn\u2019t have much clarity on when things will be back to normal in the NBA, but trusts that those in charge will make the safe, responsible decision when the time indeed comes. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave that to the league. I think Adam Silver is looking through all those options right now. Obviously, he has not set a [date] for us yet. I do think we could still see basketball this season. Could we play 17 more games? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll just have to let the league dictate that. I\u2019m sure the commissioner has a date in mind, but we don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking in that regard. We\u2019ll trust him. He\u2019s on top of it and listens to the experts. I believe he\u2019ll do the right thing by our league making sure everybody is safe and healthy.\u201d "}
{"team": "hornets", "url": "https://www.nba.com/hornets/swarm-365-heroes-community-dr-steven-gilchrist-novant-health", "date": "2020-04-22 00:00:00", "tags": ["Hornets", "COVID-19"], "article": " By Sam Perley Dr. Steven Gilchrist works as a lead physician at Novant Health Steelecroft Primary Care, and like everybody else in the medical community, his work life has been completely upended in light of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic. But Gilchrist is also taking on another role to help his patients better understand and navigate these uncertain times. \u201cI\u2019m a big sports guy and I\u2019ll tell all my patients to look at it like I\u2019m your coach,\u201d said Gilchrist. \u201cThis is a partnership. I can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play. That\u2019s our attitude, particularly with Novant. We\u2019re guns slinging, we\u2019re not shying away, we\u2019re not backing down from the virus because we have to win and we will defeat it. We need all the players on the team to play their role which means that we are serious about the stay-at-home policy.\u201d Originally from the northeastern area of North Carolina, Gilchrist and his wife, Tisha, relocated to Charlotte 13 years ago after living in Virginia Beach. \u201cWe found Charlotte and we were like, \u2018This is it. This is our home,\u2019 he said. Gilchrist has been with Novant ever since and is currently working day and night on the front lines to get a handle on the COVID-19 outbreak. \u201cMy day-to-day has been flipped upside down from left to right and side to side,\u201d he explained. \u201cOn a daily basis, we used to take care of very sick people, very healthy people all together and try and make the world a better place. Right now, we\u2019re in straight survival mode for those who need us the most. We still have the responsibility of taking care of patients that we normally would see in the office. Some of us are on the video live taking care of patients from their homes. If there\u2019s an emergency and we have to see you in the office, we will.\u201d He added, \u201cMy day-to-day includes anything from seeing a really, really sick kid that absolutely needs to be seen today to swabbing somebody for coronavirus in the parking lot. It\u2019s super unpredictable and we\u2019re just grateful we can provide a service to the community. We\u2019re going to still stay committed. If we have to meet you in the parking lot to give you an extra swab, we\u2019ll do it. If we have to work on you on a Saturday which we\u2019ve started doing now, we\u2019ll do that. Whatever you need at this unprecedented time, we are committed and we\u2019re well-trained for it.\u201d Gilchrist says that dealing with the coronavirus itself isn\u2019t so much the issue, but rather the strain it puts on the medical community in conjunction with non-COVID-19-related situations. \u201cIf it was just coronavirus and coronavirus only, we could probably do that with our eyes closed,\u201d he stated. \u201cJust give us enough equipment and the right testing tools and we\u2019ll take care of it. Our biggest challenge is taking care of the rest of the community because they have questions. They have diabetes, general illnesses, allergies. Our operating rooms are still operating only on emergency basis only.\u201d \u201cI think our community has grasped staying home and letting the virus die down. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job with that. This is a mentally and physically grueling challenge. I always wondered when I was in training why in the world they were making us work 80 to 120 hours a week. That should not happen, but now I see why. Gilchrist was in his sixth season as a Swarm 365 member before the NBA halted play on March 11 and like many in and around the organization, can\u2019t wait to see what lies ahead for the Hornets. \u201cI was super excited about this season, but probably more excited about what\u2019s to come in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cOur guys are just high energy. I can\u2019t say enough about Devonte\u2019 Graham and how he has stepped up. To see him come from the G League to one of the premier players in the NBA, it\u2019s just amazing. I can say the same thing for about four or five of the guys. I think there was a buzz in the city about the Hornets and how they\u2019re showing up. This was probably the most exciting Hornets team I\u2019ve seen in the last five years.\u201d Sports play a huge role in the Gilchrist family, which also includes 17-year-old son Jalen and 11 and 8-year-old daughters Kennedy and Raegan. But like many in this new stay-at-home normal, the five are finding ways to stay busy and in some ways, make up for lost time in the process. \u201cThis is a bittersweet time for us because my son is a high school senior and he\u2019s getting ready to transition on over to college. With my career, I\u2019ve worked a lot and coached him a lot, but these are those last few moments before he goes away. We\u2019re catching up on video games, working out, riding bikes, baking pizzas. There\u2019s probably never going to be another time in our life, my kids\u2019 lifetime or even my grandkids\u2019 lifetime when we\u2019ll see the world stop for three or four months. We\u2019re filling the time, but we definitely miss sports, especially my Hornets.\u201d Hornets basketball and other sports will eventually return and with first responders like Dr. Steven Gilchrist fighting daily against the pandemic, they\u2019ll be met by a safer, healthier community when they do.

It\u2019s a good thing he did, because the 20-year-old wing came up with a few big-time clutch plays to help the Boston Celtics hold off a late Hawks rally inside TD Garden. Atlanta was soaring down the final stretch, as it cut what was once a 17-point Celtics lead down to five with less than three minutes remaining. That's when Langford made his first game-changing play. After John Collins tossed in a layup that brought the score to 101-96, Langford ran up-court to the left corner. That's where Marcus Smart found him wide open on a drive-and-dish, which Langford caught and converted for a 3-pointer to put the C's back up by eight. One minute later, Langford found himself wide open in that same corner. This time, however, he cut to the basket as Smart delivered him a perfect alley-oop dime, which Langford laid in with ease. Langford's final and most impactful set of clutch plays came on the other end of the court during the last possession of the game. Atlanta had pulled back within three points and was looking to tie the game at 110 to send it into overtime. Kevin Huerter, who was being guarded by Langford, received a pass at the top of the arc and dribbled twice to his left before pulling up from deep. Langford, though, stuck to Huerter like glue and was able to force him into a miss. However, the Hawks batted the offensive rebound out to a wide-open Brandon Goodwin for one last chance. Goodwin got off a great look, but the ball caromed high off the back-rim and into the hands of \u2013\u00a0you guessed it \u2013 Langford. The rookie first-round pick was fouled with two seconds remaining and went to the free-throw line, where he sunk both of his attempts to secure a 112-107 victory. Jayson Tatum has been setting all sorts of career-high marks this season. On Friday night, he established another. The All-Star wing sunk seven 3-pointers on 12 attempts, which surpassed his previous career-best of six which he set less than one month ago against New Orleans. Tatum also made three field goals from inside the arc and five shots from the free-throw line, giving him a game-high 32 points on the night. The 21-year-old rising star rounded out his night with a game-high-tying six assists, four rebounds, including three on the offensive end, and two blocked shots during 38 minutes of action.

Many of these ailments (as well as COVID-19) are transmitted via human contact, but like most other African countries, a \u2018stay home\u2019 policy simply isn\u2019t feasible. \u201cHow can we save lives and how can we prevent more people from getting infected?\u201d, asked Biyombo. \u201cThe president announced a stay-at-home order, but at the same time, [much] of the population is jobless. They\u2019re dependent on contacting somebody. How can people understand this idea of stabilizing the country and what we\u2019ll have to go about doing?\u201d One primary focus of The Bismack Biyombo Foundation (which was established in 2016) has been the refurbishing of Congolese hospitals to the point where they\u2019re simply meeting basic requirements. Like fellow countryman and Basketball Hall-of-Famer Dikembe Mutombo has already done, Biyombo plans to construct new medical facilities at some point once the ones already in place have been updated. \u201cThe reality of refurbishing hospitals is we\u2019re just getting them serviceable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d have to prepare for a pandemic. Nobody expected this. Refurbishing hospitals was the last thing we wanted to do before we start building new ones. Now, the whole world is dealing with this. How can we start finding ways to get ahead of this?\u201d Volunteers will be distributing the supplies once they arrive in the DRC and while Biyombo\u2019s plans to visit Africa again this summer are likely postponed, the Hornets center is still doing everything in his power to help his home country in need from afar.

And when the time came to relocate after medical school almost 10 years ago, Bhowmick and his then-girlfriend, now-wife Amber, came across the total package in Charlotte, NC. \u201cGrowing up in the 90\u2019s, it was all Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls,\u201d Bhowmick said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody was in to. My workout room is just top to bottom Jordan\u2019s. I grew up idolizing that team and his greatness. Leaving Mississippi and looking for a place that still had that Southern culture, but also more diverse and larger, Charlotte was just an option that when it came, I just jumped at it.\u201d During a cross-country flight to Oakland shortly after the couple had moved, Amber sat next to a Bobcats season ticket holder and after some dialogue, the latter encouraged her to reach out to the organization. Safe to say, it didn\u2019t take too much convincing to get Sumon on board. \u201cShe knew that I loved basketball \u2013 maybe not as much at the time \u2013 but she knew I was really into it. She got the card for a sales rep and when she came back, we called them up. I had just started my new career working in Lincoln County. It was just the two of us on this new adventure at the time, so we were just looking to live it up and check out the arena. I was sold immediately because it\u2019s professional basketball and it was run by Michael Jordan.\u201d He added with a laugh, \u201cAmber at the time looked at me and was like, \u2018You haven\u2019t even gotten an engagement ring for me yet and you\u2019re about to drop all this money on tickets?\u2019 Three months later, we got engaged, so she was fine!\u201d Soon-to-be five-year-old twin boys, a three-year-old daughter and a move to South Charlotte later, Sumon and Amber are still in the same section today albeit a few rows closer behind the Hornets bench. But like everything else in the sporting world at the moment, NBA basketball games have been suspended for over a month now in response to the ongoing worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Bhowmick currently works as a pediatrician at Novant Health Waverly Pediatrics and Primary Care, while Amber is also a pediatric and critical care nurse. Bhowmick recently spent time working at a drive-up screening center for COVID-19 and like others in the medical field, his day-to-day routine has been greatly impacted by the new social distancing guidelines. \u201cWhat this pandemic has ushered us into is more teleconferencing, virtual visits, Zoom, stuff like that on a regular basis to see patients,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur clinic is pediatrics and primary care, so we have adults, too. The emphasis is not just toward diverting and giving people support they need on the front lines, but also making sure our patients themselves are able to get the care that they need. Kids still get sick, allergies are acting up. They want to be seen and talk about what\u2019s going on, but in the safest way possible.\u201d Nobody knows what things will look like when the pandemic is over, but the world will undoubtedly be a different place in more ways than one. On a positive note though, Bhowmick is convinced that the way doctors and others in the medicinal world interact with patients after all of this is over will be greatly improved. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better at this. We\u2019re actually kind of enjoying the virtual visits, too, because we\u2019re able to help people quickly and give them what they need,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending too much time inconveniencing them. Our staff is usually taking temperatures and vital signs, but now they\u2019re working IT and helping people set up their computers. We\u2019re all really just trying to figure out what our role is in this. I think in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s actually going to make us care for our families even better because it gives us more access.\u201d Bhowmick has also seen a lot in terms of basketball over his 10 years as a season ticket holder having watched the likes of Gerald Wallace, Stephen Jackson, Kemba Walker and many others leading up to a youth movement that was hitting its stride when play was halted on March 11. \u201cThese young guys like Devonte\u2019 and Miles, they\u2019ve really just shown us they have the heart. I\u2019m going to ride with them no matter what happens because I need to see how this works! I really like the Martin twins. All of these guys are scrappy dudes,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest, I just like watching them play as hard as they play. JB has been constantly positive about everything. He had to inherit a lot of responsibility. I feel very confident with him at the helm doing things. I feel like we have a good opportunity for these players to keep developing.\u201d But becoming Swarm 365 members has been about more than just attending NBA games on a regularly basis for the Bhowmicks \u2013 something Sumon didn\u2019t experience too often growing up in a state without any of the four major sports. And soon, it might even be a full family event. \u201cWe sat in the section where Kemba\u2019s mom used to sit and have become close friends with the people in our section. When our twins were born, Kemba\u2019s mother made some blankets for us. There\u2019s this whole community aspect of being part of it. It really just made us feel like it was not just a sports thing. We have not taken our kids to many basketball games yet because they\u2019re still a little bit too young, but I totally see in the future that if the kids get the good grades, they\u2019re going to sit with me. I\u2019m still going! They\u2019ll come with me, we\u2019ll get something to eat, we\u2019ll get some autographs, they\u2019ll catch a T-shirt, everything.\u201d For now, Sumon, Amber and many other heroic doctors, nurses and first responders will continue fighting COVID-19 on the front lines and protecting as many people as possible from the effects of the coronavirus and other illnesses. \u201cSports has always been a great way to bring people together and get people talking,\u201d Bhowmick added. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough to have that missing, but at the same time, I have this unique standpoint. The basketball fanatic and huge fan that I am of the Hornets and sports in general is just itching for that to be back. This is so important that we get this under as good a control as possible. Adam Silver has been such an incredible NBA commissioner because he has that progressive thinking and he makes those tough calls. Get it right and shut it down. As much as people are chomping at the bit for sports and basketball to be back in our life, we have to make sure we\u2019re doing this right.\u201d "}

{"team": "celtics", "url": "https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/post-ups-20200209", "article": " OKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 Rookie Romeo Langford was thrown into his first NBA crunch-time situation Friday night against Atlanta and delivered two clutch baskets, a couple of big-time defensive plays, and a pair of game-sealing free-throws to help the Boston Celtics escape with a 112-107 win. What was most impressive about the 20-year-old\u2019s performance was the poise with which he played. In what would have been a heart-pounding moment for most young players, Langford appeared as though he wasn\u2019t breaking a sweat. In fact, it didn\u2019t even look as though he was breathing, much to coach Brad Stevens\u2019 amazement, during a 16-point, five-rebound, three-block performance over 29 minutes of turnover-free action. \u201cI always wondered about the guys that don\u2019t seem like they have a pulse when they\u2019re walking around \u2013 that everything just kind of goes off their shoulder,\u201d Stevens pondered ahead of Sunday afternoon\u2019s game in Oklahoma City. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few guys like that over the years, and you throw them in during huge, huge moments and they still don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re affected by it. And I mean that in a good way. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job in those moments,\u201d the coach added. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be overwhelmed by anything. He\u2019s just got a lot of learning to do and a lot of growing to do. But he had a couple of defensive plays the other day that were really special. And then he made the huge 3 in the corner, the one that gave us a little bit of breathing room there.\u201d Heading into this past week, Langford had not seen many long stints of playing time. However, the Celtics have relied upon him over the last few games as they\u2019ve dealt with a plethora of injuries to key rotation players. Stevens is more than happy with what the young wing has brought to the team during the stretch of undermanned play. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can score the ball on drives, and his shot has gotten way better \u2013 he\u2019s worked hard on it,\u201d Stevens noted. \u201cAnd then defensively, I think he\u2019s just so versatile. You can throw him in with our other wings, and we just have a lot of options defensively. He can switch, he can guard a bunch of different positions, he\u2019s stronger than he looks, and we think he\u2019s got a huge upside. He did a good job when we had guys out, kind of holding down the fort the last couple of games.\u201d The Celtics will welcome three of their previously-injured starters back tonight (Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Daniel Theis), which means Langford likely won\u2019t see as much playing time as he has over the last couple of games. But at least the Celtics now know that they have another talented and composed option in Langford who they can turn to down the stretch if needed. - Taylor Snow "}

The 21-year-old forward wasn\u2019t the typical quiet and reserved rookie. In fact, he was quite the opposite. \u201cHe talks too much,\u201d a smiling Smart said Friday his Celtics hosted the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cNo, he\u2019s great, man \u2026 He talks a lot, but he knows what he's talking about, and it's all in good faith.\u201d Before Williams arrived, Smart was without a doubt most talkative player on the team. But now, that role is up for debate, and it's quite a surprise that a rookie is the one who is challenging Smart for it. \u201cIt's rare,\u201d Smart said of Williams\u2019 talkative ways. \u201cEspecially as a rookie, it's very rare. Usually, rookies, they come in, they're shy, they're trying to figure out where they belong, they don't want to overstep their boundaries. But Grant, he just comes in and he doesn't care. He's very secure with himself. And when you've got a guy like that, it's good. It\u2019s good for Grant, and it's good for us, as well.\u201d Williams\u2019 talkative ways are most valuable when he is in the game. His constant communication has been key for Boston on both ends of the floor. \u201cWhen he's on the court and he's out there helping our defense and helping our offense and moving and talking the way he does, everybody is happy,\u201d said Smart. \u201cHaving Grant, it helps us a lot.\u201d - Taylor Snow "}

Terry Rozier (40 points) and Caleb Martin (23) both tallied new career highs on Monday night, but it just wasn\u2019t enough to avoid a tough 143-138 double overtime loss to the divisional rival Hawks. The final outcome wasn\u2019t what the team was hoping for, although it did notably mark the sixth time in seven games the Hornets have found themselves in clutch time. \u201cThe way we closed out regulation and overtime, I thought they played the right way,\u201d said Coach Borrego on Monday night. \u201cThey\u2019re growing, they\u2019re getting better, it\u2019s exciting.

Miami also connected on 12-of-22 three-pointers in the opening half (54.5%), while the Hornets recorded 29 points on 19 Heat giveaways in the contest. Miami has won five of six and own\u2019s the NBA\u2019s second-best home record at 27-4. The offense is very well balanced with Butler (18.0 PPG), Adebayo (17.7), Goran Dragi\u0107 (17.4 PPG), Duncan Robinson (17.0 PPG) and Kendrick Nunn (16.4) all averaging at least 15.0 PPG over the team\u2019s last 10 outings (6-4). Once a Division III player who went undrafted two summers ago, Robinson is currently third in the NBA in both total threes (240) and three-point percentage (45.3%). Miami currently leads the NBA in long-distance efficiency (38.4%), thanks largely to the efforts of Robinson, Olynyk (43.7%), Meyers Leonard (42.9%) and newcomer Jae Crowder (40.2%). The Hornets allowed Atlanta to connect on 21-of-43 three-point attempts (48.8%) on Monday evening and will need to do a much better job guarding the perimeter in tonight\u2019s showdown with the hometown Heat. Game Notes: Miami G Tyler Herro (right ankle soreness) and C/F Meyers Leonard (left ankle sprain) have both been sidelined since Feb. 3. F/G Jimmy Butler exited Sunday\u2019s game vs. Washington (left toe injury) and did not return\u2026 The Hornets are 2-9 against the Heat in their last 11 meetings (1-5 in Miami). "}

Miami led 40-22 after the first 12 minutes, connecting on staggering 16-of-19 shot attempts (84.2%) and 8-of-9 three-pointers (88.9%) in the frame.

Terry Rozier finished with a career-high 40 points on 15-of-26 shooting, four rebounds and three assists in the loss. Rozier also went a career-best 8-of-13 from long distance, marking his third consecutive game with at least five three-point field goals (19-of-31 overall; 61.3%). Charlotte rallied from five down at the 2:03 mark of regulation to take a one-point lead with just over five seconds remaining. After Caleb Martin fouled Trae Young on the ensuing Atlanta possession, the latter missed the second free throw, sending the game to overtime. Still tied with three seconds left in the first extra frame, a drawn foul on Rozier was overturned on a coach\u2019s challenge, extending the game another five minutes. The visitors eventually found themselves down by three with 24 seconds left in double overtime, but Rozier knotted the score at 138-138 following his eighth triple of the night. On the other end, De\u2019Andre Hunter drew another costly foul on Martin while shooting a three-pointer, sending him to the line with 13 seconds left. Upon sinking all three shots, Rozier couldn\u2019t get another equalizer to fall, effectively ending the 58-minute affair. \u201cThey\u2019re resilient, they\u2019re tough.

Caleb Martin\u2019s output marks the highest-scoring performance by an undrafted Hornets rookie since Walter Herrmann had 30 points in Milwaukee on April 14, 2007. Young paced the Hawks with 31 points and a game-high 16 assists in the win, which snapped the team\u2019s three-game skid. John Collins finished with 28 points on a crisp 12-of-13 shooting and 11 rebounds and Hunter also double-doubled with 13 points and 11 rebounds.

While the team\u2019s record might just be 3-3 since this particular outing, that mark doesn\u2019t necessarily tell the whole story. During this stretch, the Hornets sit seventh in the NBA in defensive rating (107.4) and 11th in net rating (1.8), rankings that stood at 26th (113.1) and 28th (-8.2), respectively, through the opening 57 outings. The offense is lagging behind just a bit (109.3 rating is 23rd in the NBA over these six games), but in order for this young team to be successful, it has to begin with defense. \u201cIt\u2019s important for our guys to understand that it starts on the defensive end for us,\u201d said Coach Borrego on March 1 after the Hornets became the first team to hold Milwaukee to under 100 points since Feb. 2019. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been where we needed to defensively for the last year and a half. We are turning the corner. I think a lot of it has to do with the personnel we have on the floor right now, with the length and the size, the athleticism and the way we\u2019re building this thing is to compete with teams like we saw tonight.\u201d \u201cAfter the Indiana game, it didn\u2019t sit well with us, so we told ourselves that we were going to come out, play hard and give everybody our best efforts and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said Terry Rozier after a 108-99 home win over Houston on March 7. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys that can play hard, score the ball. We have just been having fun out there \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing. You don\u2019t want to lose your fun out there.\u201d Two of the squad\u2019s losses during this span have come at the buzzer and another came to Milwaukee by eight, a contest that was tied with about four minutes remaining. The Hornets have allowed just 11.5 second-chance points per game since Feb. 26, the eighth-lowest mark in the NBA (13.4 PPG beforehand). They also rank sixth in percentage of offensive loose balls recovered (55.8%), second in charges drawn (1.33) and 10th in contested two-point shots (35.5). Most notably, the team\u2019s play over the last two weeks has involved contributions from nearly every player in the rotation. Devonte\u2019 Graham is averaging 20.6 PPG on 44.7% shooting (36.4% from three) and 5.2 APG in five outings since sitting out the Pacers game for resting purposes. Rozier is also putting up 20.0 PPG, while shooting 51.3% from distance and PJ Washington has tallied at least 19 points in three straight games for the first time this season. Off the bench, Willy Hernang\u00f3mez (7.8 PPG and 7.5 RPG) and Cody Martin (7.0 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 5.0 APG and 1.3 SPG) are also making significant contributions. Add in the lengthy, versatile Jalen McDaniels (5.8 PPG and 4.5 RPG in 12 GP since Feb. 8) and Caleb Martin (8.7 PPG on 56.3% shooting over his last 3 GP) and Charlotte\u2019s certainly had quite a promising glance at its future core. Borrego knows his team isn\u2019t where it wants to be just yet. There will still be plenty of growing pains with bumps and bruises to follow over the final 19 outings of the campaign. But one of the greatest measures of success in the NBA is how a team gets better or worse over the course of a long season and at the moment, indisputable improvements have been made. \u201cI think we got better,\u201d said Borrego, when asked about his biggest takeaway from the four-game homestand. \u201cWe talked about it and said let\u2019s get better after these four games. I didn\u2019t know if we were going to win one, two, three or four, but let\u2019s go compete and let\u2019s get better. We checked all those boxes. We competed every single night, had a shot to win every single game. Let\u2019s keep it up. Let\u2019s hit the road and keep defending.\u201d "}

Russell Westbrook (rest) will end up missing both games against the Hornets this season, meaning wings Robert Covington, House Jr., and Ben McLemore should see an uptick in usage.

A local women\u2019s rugby coach at the time, Vestal was tiring a bit on the role and about to call it quits when the Charlotte Royals Rugby Football Club \u2013 a Charlotte-based squad for gay, bisexual and straight allies \u2013 reached out in hopes she\u2019d reconsider diving back in. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it anymore and had gotten tired of it, but then the Charlotte Royals called and said they were missing a coach and if I\u2019d be interested in doing it,\u201d recalled Vestal. \u201cI was like, \u2018Mhmm, I\u2019ve never coached a men\u2019s team before.\u2019 So, I gave it a shot and fell in love with the team and the guys.\u201d \u201cI was nervous at first [coaching men for the first time]. I knew the team because they had practiced with the women\u2019s team for a little bit. Still, I felt like I didn\u2019t know enough or I wasn\u2019t prepared. As I kept going with it, I realized this is something I know how to do and it is something I can do. I do have something to offer. Those guys never skipped a beat with it and [being coached by a woman] was never an issue.\u201d Nominated by her spouse, Erin Goldstein, Vestal will be recognized by the Charlotte Hornets between the first and second quarters of Thursday\u2019s game with their first-ever For the Love of the Game Award. This honor (which will be presented by Bank of America in conjunction with the organization\u2019s second annual Pride Night) was created to recognize an LGBTQ or LGBTQ ally student-athlete, coach or sports organization that has been a champion for change to help create inclusive athletic environments. Originally founded in 2004, the Royals began with just four players, but have ballooned to nearly 30 current participants. A member of the International Gay Men\u2019s Rugby Association (an international organization that promotes inclusivity in rugby with the LGBTQ community) the team has traveled and competed all over the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands. In 2018, the Charlotte Royals captured the Hoagland Shield at the 2018 Bingham Cup in Amsterdam, a tournament dedicated to late rugby player Mark Bingham. A pioneer in the LGBTQ sporting community, Bingham was one of the passengers that led the effort to retake United Flight 93 on Sept. 11, 2001 that ultimately crashed near Shanksville, PA. Past and present team members are from all different backgrounds and include both gay allies and trans people. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care as long as you want to learn to play,\u201d Vestal said. Many competitors have never played sports at any point prior to joining the Royals, and really, the only requirement is simply having a willingness to try something new. \u201cA lot of the guys we coach, they already feel intimidated because they didn\u2019t grow up playing sports,\u201d explained Vestal. \u201cA lot of the guys we have didn\u2019t play sports throughout high school. When you go play a club team that\u2019s a straight team, a lot of those guys played sports throughout high school, maybe college, whatever.\u201d \u201cA lot of the younger guys coming in do have confidence issues. Building them up and letting them know that in rugby, we\u2019re going to make mistakes. Just keep coming out, keep playing and we\u2019ll love you anyways. We\u2019re not a pro sports team. We\u2019re a bunch of people who come and play rugby for fun. I do this for fun. This is my social activity, my hobby, my passion. I don\u2019t know who would do this if you didn\u2019t love the game and love playing.\u201d Of note, the Royals will be hosting the 2021 International Gay Rugby North American Championship, a testament to how much the program has taken off. Much like rugby is growing in popularity in the United States, so is acceptance in the LGBTQ community. There is still a gap to bridge, but being gay and playing sports (especially such a physically demanding one like rugby) are no longer as mutually exclusive from one another as they once were. \u201cWe used to never play in North Carolina unless we hosted another gay team from another city,\u201d Vestal said. \u201cIt felt like a [straight] team would try extra hard because they didn\u2019t want to get beat by a gay team. We used to be really hesitant to play them. Society in general as evolved a lot in 12 years. We\u2019d be more comfortable playing other gay clubs, but now I\u2019d say it\u2019s different. We\u2019ve had a mindset change and things are more accepted.\u201d \u201cCharlotte\u2019s a big city, but not a huge city. When you play against teams from London, Sydney, New York, Chicago and Atlanta, they already have a built-in rugby community. We were a smaller community. The first international tournament we played, we took exactly 15 people. That\u2019s how many you need to play and we were going to play in a three-day tournament. Now, we go and bring 25 people to the same tournament and we win. We\u2019re getting better, our rugby knowledge is getting better. It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019re a gay team.\u201d The goal for Vestal and the Charlotte Royals isn\u2019t to ultimately win championships (although that\u2019s always a motivating factor in any sport), but rather to foster a productive outlet that promotes acceptance and belonging. And regardless of one\u2019s sexual orientation or other differences, everybody out there has a purpose when it comes to rugby or anything else in life. \u201cThere\u2019s a position for almost every single person, body type, whatever on the rugby field,\u201d Vestal stated. \u201cIt does get better. High school is really hard and there is a lot of things going on there. Even getting into college, especially for LGBTQ people coming out and being a part of that process, once you find your home and your family, it gets better and it gets easier. I promise and sports is a great way to continue growing your family.\u201d "}

Despite trailing by 17 points in the second quarter, the San Antonio Spurs rallied to squeak out a late 104-103 win over the Hornets on Tuesday evening. Terry Rozier (20 points), PJ Washington (19) and Miles Bridges (15) all scored 15+ points for a Hornets squad that committed 17 turnovers for 19 opposing points and was without starting point guard Devonte\u2019 Graham (left ankle soreness) as well. \u201cI think everybody stepped up,\u201d said Washington after the loss. \u201cWe knew it was going to be hard without [Devonte\u2019]. We tried to fill his role a little bit, but he\u2019s obviously one of the better players in this league. We need him and we\u2019ll be excited when he comes back.\u201d Coach Borrego added, \u201cWithout Devonte\u2019, other guys were handling the ball and that was an issue for us with turnovers, but in general, we fought and competed.\u201d Charlotte wrapped up a four-game road trip with a 100-86 loss in Denver back on Jan. 15, getting a team-high 20 points from Rozier and 14 points apiece from Washington, Bridges and Graham. Michael Porter Jr. (19 points), Mason Plumlee (15) and two-way player PJ Dozier (12) helped the Nuggets\u2019 bench outscore its visiting counterpart by a whopping and decisive 52-13 margin. Denver has claimed wins in seven of its last 11 outings, although is coming off a 116-100 home loss to the last-place Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, a game in which it was outscored by 15 points in the fourth quarter. The Nuggets lead the NBA in offensive rating during this stretch (117.0), sit 21st in defensive rating (113.9) and are allowing the fifth-most opposing points off turnovers (19.6 PPG). Reigning All-NBA First-Team center Nikola Joki\u0107 (23.2 PPG on 62.3% shooting and 7.2 APG) and Jamal Murray (22.5 PPG on 51.4% shooting; 40.0% from three) continue to be the focal points of the Denver offense across this aforementioned stretch. After forcing just 10 turnovers against San Antonio, the Hornets\u2019 defense needs to get back to being disruptive in order to keep the visiting Nuggets on their heels at the other end. Game Notes: Denver F Noah Vonleh (right ankle sprain) has missed the team\u2019s last three outings\u2026 Charlotte has won three straight home meetings with Denver (last loss: March 19, 2016)\u2026 The Nuggets are 15-8 against the Eastern Conference this season and 17-12 overall on the road.

Terry Rozier finished with a team-high 20 points (10 in the fourth), six rebounds and five assists in the loss. PJ Washington was right behind the veteran guard in the scoring department, putting up another 19 points (5-of-9 from three), four rebounds and three assists. San Antonio trailed by 17 in the second before rallying to enter the fourth with a slim 77-76 lead. Both sides went back and forth over the final 12 minutes with the Spurs pulling ahead by seven at the 2:12 mark. The Hornets responded with a 6-0 run and after a missed DeMar DeRozan jumper and the clock winding down, Rozier drove to the basket and wrapped a pass around Bryn Forbes that was just a touch too hot to handle for Cody Martin. \u201cI thought we had a good look. I\u2019ll have to watch and see why we didn\u2019t get a shot off there,\u201d said Coach Borrego afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to set their defense. I thought we had them on their heels a little bit the last few possessions. We were getting to the rim. I just felt like letting our guys play in that moment.

The hosts dominated on the glass, 47-33, which included a 15-6 advantage in offensive boards (21-3 differential in second-chance points).

The Hornets are coming off a hard-fought 93-85 home loss to the NBA-leading Bucks on Sunday afternoon, becoming the first team in the NBA to hold Milwaukee to less than 100 points this season. Charlotte sits fourth in defensive rating since Feb. 10 (104.3; 5-3 record), an extremely impressive mark for a squad that ranked 28th (113.7) prior to this recent eight-game stretch. \u201cComing out of the All-Star break, we had a couple keys \u2013 both of them being on the defensive end,\u201d said Borrego after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cWe\u2019re limiting teams right now in the paint and we\u2019re swarming. Everything is challenged and difficult. We\u2019re switching a lot more. This is probably the best defense we\u2019ve played in the last two years. There is a pride about it right now.\u201d Charlotte led the Spurs by 19 early in the third on Feb. 1, but eventually got outscored by 37 points in the second half (64-27 differential) in what ended as a 114-90 road loss. Miles Bridges racked up a team-high 25 points on 10-of-19 shooting and Cody Zeller nearly triple-doubled with 14 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high eight assists. DeMar DeRozan had 24 points and Jakob Poeltl added another 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting for San Antonio in the win. Since this victory though, the Spurs have lost seven of 10 outings, ranking 24th in offensive (117.3) and 27th in defensive rating (117.3). DeRozan (20.1 PPG), LaMarcus Aldridge (18.4), Dejounte Murray (12.0), Bryn Forbes (11.6), Patty Mills (10.7), Derrick White (10.6) and Trey Lyles (10.0) are all averaging double-figure points for an offensively-balanced San Antonio team across this stretch. Despite their recent struggles, San Antonio has been the NBA\u2019s second-best defensive rebounding team (77.5%) since Feb. 1, although oddly the worst offensive rebounding team (21.6%) at the same time. The Spurs also own the league\u2019s lowest turnover percentage in this time frame (10.4%), so that swarming Hornets\u2019 defense will need to continue to be physical and disruptive in order to create extra opportunities on the offensive end.

I came from a less diverse area in northern Virginia and I knew I wanted to go to place where I would see a lot more people like me succeeding. When I stepped on the campus of WSSU, it was literally eye-opening. It changed my life from the second I got there and by the time I left, I was leading the charge a little bit and setting examples for people behind me. When I came out into the work force, it definitely set me up for success. I can\u2019t thank WSSU enough. I try and give back every time I can, go to games, go to everything because I owe them so much.\u201d What does Black History Month mean to you?  \u201cIt\u2019s a specific time that we can focus on literally Black History. I think a lot of people in their personal lives, if it\u2019s a birthday, they\u2019ll reflect and think it\u2019s a great time. I think that\u2019s what Black History Month is for an entire race. Let\u2019s sit back and reflect on what we\u2019ve done in the past and what we can do in the future. It\u2019s also a good learning tool for a lot of the youth coming up now. There\u2019s a lot more ways that you can find information like YouTube and social media and now, there\u2019s Black History Month stuff everywhere. It\u2019s a specified time to look at your history and be proud of it, but I think it should continue all the way throughout the year as well.\u201d How do you see yourself as a role model in the Black community?  \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t operate on faith, so they need to see something and they need to see it in front of them. I try and be that in my industry and for the people that look up to me. When I was in college, people would always laugh at me when I said I was going to work at ESPN, be on TV and produce things. They were like, \u2018You don\u2019t have any background in that,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019 Through years and years of work, I got there. Then I told people I wanted to come work for the Hornets and go back to my second home in North Carolina and now, I\u2019m doing it. A lot of people that see me, they now believe they can do it themselves. For me personally, that\u2019s who I want to be. I want somebody to say, \u2018Cornell did that. I know I can do it, too.\u2019 Leading by example is how I see myself as a role model.\u201d Who are the most influential Black role models in your life?  \u201cWhen I think of Black role models in my life, it\u2019s literally everyone I\u2019ve encountered in my close personal circle, starting of course with my parents, Theodore Sr. and Dr. Zella Jones. They set the example for my brother, Theodore Jr. and I in our personal household. My mom is a doctor and principal and my dad\u2019s a therapist. My dad would come home every day and say, \u2018Sit down. We\u2019re going to talk about your day. We\u2019re going to set this up and do different things.\u2019 They both set me up for greatness.\u201d \u201cWhen I got to WSSU, you select your family there. These are going to be the people who stick with you for the rest of your life. I was blessed to select two amazing friends in Desmond Barnes and Jonathan Jackson, who to this day, challenge me in ways I couldn\u2019t have imagined. I look up to them more than they know. WSSU also brought me my wife, Vanity. She pushes me harder than anybody can. When I think I\u2019ve done something great, she\u2019s like, \u2018You can do better.\u2019 I sit back and look at that tight circle, which includes my brother, my extended family and everybody that supports me.\u201d \u201cMy church family as well at First A.M.E. of Manassas. When I got to ESPN the first time, my church family wrote a letter to the company pretty much saying, \u2018We just want to let you know that we believe in Cornell. Thank you for the opportunities he\u2019s getting.\u2019 That was literally the whole letter and 400 people signed it. To have that kind of support behind me in anything that I do is amazing. When I moved down here to the Hornets, my church family knew what I was doing, that I had a plan for what I was going to do and supported me no matter what. I do consider them all role models because they instill in me what to do on a daily basis. To have that background is amazing. Not everybody has that role model, especially in the African-American community. I just want to be that for as many people as I can in a personal sense.\u201d "}

Thanks to a pair of bounce-back performances from Terry Rozier (26 points) and Devonte\u2019 Graham (21 points), the Hornets withstood a late Knicks rally and picked up a 107-101 home win on Wednesday night. For Graham particularly, the outing was much welcomed after he shot 1-of-17 from the field in his first two post-All-Star Break appearances, a cold stretch that prompted a rest day on Tuesday night in Indiana. \u201cIt felt great. Definitely haven\u2019t been playing up to how I should be,\u201d the second-year guard said after the victory. \u201cJust trying to get back mentally, get a little rest, recover, extra treatment, cold tub, steam room, all of that. Trying to get my mind off everything and just come back and compete at a high level.\u201d Charlotte led Toronto by 10 with under six minutes remaining in their most recent meeting on Jan. 6 at Spectrum Center before the latter rallied to win in overtime, 112-110. Rozier (27) and Miles Bridges (26) led the team in scoring and PJ Washington double-doubled with 12 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Serge Ibaka and undrafted rookie Terence Davis both had 23 points for the Raptors, who were missing Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and Marc Gasol. The reigning champs have won nine of their last 10 at home (only loss coming to Milwaukee) and are 17-2 since Jan. 15. Siakam (22.2 PPG), Ibaka (17.1 PPG and 7.1 RPG), Kyle Lowry (17.0 PPG and 7.5 APG) and VanVleet (16.9 PPG and 1.9 SPG) are leading a balanced Raptors squad that ranks third in the NBA in offensive rating (115.9) and second in defensive rating (105.6) over this 19-game span. In what was expected to be a down year following the offseason departure of last year\u2019s Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, the 42-16 Raptors have played exceptionally well this year and seen minimal drop-off in results. Picking up a win will be a tough task for the Hornets, but keeping the turnovers down (averaging 18.0 in two games vs. Toronto) and crashing the glass (allowing an average of 15.0 offensive rebounds in the season series) will be imperative in order to pick up a fourth win in five road appearances. Game Notes: Toronto leads the season series, 2-0. The Hornets have dropped four of their last five road games against the Raptors (lone win: 115-114 on March 24, 2019)\u2026 Toronto is just 5-5 this season with exactly two days off between games (lost at home to Milwaukee on Tuesday night).

Charlotte compiled its most complete, balanced 48-minute game of the season two nights ago, edging out the Toronto Raptors for an impressive (and dramatic) 99-96 road win. After enduring blowout losses last Saturday and Tuesday evening, the Hornets have regained a bit of momentum and confidence heading into what will be a challenging four-game homestand. \u201cWe needed this,\u201d said Terry Rozier, who finished with a team-high-tying 18 points, which included the go-ahead technical free throw with 2.1 seconds left. \u201cWe won our last game, so we\u2019re just looking to keep building. It\u2019s a special team (Toronto) that we just played against, so every time we get a chance to beat a special team, it makes us feel good.\u201d Milwaukee leads the season series with Charlotte, 2-0, and took the most recent meeting, 116-103 back on Jan. 24 in Paris. Leading the way for the Hornets was Malik Monk, who had a career-high 31 points with Devonte\u2019 Graham adding 19 points and team-high seven boards. Giannis Antetokounmpo amassed game-high totals in scoring (30 points), rebounding (16) and assists (6) and Eric Bledsoe tallied 20 points and five assists to help Milwaukee snag its 40th win of the campaign. Unsurprisingly, the 51-8 Bucks sit near the top of the league in offensive rating (113.5; third) and defensive rating (101.3; first). Milwaukee is coming off a 47-point home win over Oklahoma City on Friday night, moving its record to 24-3 since Dec. 27. Since the All-Star Break, Khris Middleton is leading the team in scoring (28.8 PPG on 57.3% shooting), while Antetokounmpo is putting up 27.4 PPG, 15.8 RPG, 5.6 APG and 1.2 BPG in just 30.2 MPG in the team\u2019s five outings (5-0). Having won five of its last seven games, Charlotte\u2019s improving defense (which ranks seventh in the NBA since Feb. 10), has helped the team overcome some recent struggles on the offensive end. Keeping the turnovers down, the rebounds up and the defense locked in will once again be huge factors for the Hornets as they look to pick up a third straight win this afternoon. Game Notes: Bucks F Khris Middleton (sore neck) missed Friday\u2019s game\u2026 Bucks F Marvin Williams will be making his first appearance in Charlotte since signing with Milwaukee on Feb. 10. He ranks third in Hornets team history in three-point field goals (681) and eighth in total rebounds (2,293). "}

Terry Rozier and Devonte\u2019 Graham led the way for the visitors with 18 points apiece, while dishing out six and five assists, respectively, in the victory. Charlotte picked up its fourth win in its last five road appearances, while the Raptors have now dropped consecutive games for the first time since Dec. 23-25. Charlotte led by 17 in the second quarter, but Toronto rallied in the fourth and eventually got the score knotted at 96-96 with 52.8 seconds remaining. After Graham\u2019s go-ahead triple rimmed out, Norman Powell and Kyle Lowry each missed three-point attempts for Toronto, giving Charlotte one last chance with 2.1 seconds to go. On the next possession, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson fouled Rozier before the inbounds pass, sending the latter to the free-throw line. After the make, Toronto then fouled Graham once the ball was in play, who followed suite and hit his two freebies to extend the advantage to three. Powell got a three off at the other end, but came up short thanks to some tremendous defense from rookie Cody Martin. \u201cI take 100 free throws every day,\u201d said Rozier. \u201cIt\u2019s just the same shot that I always shoot if I\u2019m in the gym with a lot of people or if I\u2019m in the gym by myself. I just took my time, tried to knock it down and make a smart play. I\u2019m just happy we got the win. My teammates played very well. We were coached well throughout the game and we needed this one.\u201d \u201cWe stayed in the moment,\u201d said Coach Borrego afterwards. \u201cProbably one of our best wins of the season. We were complete end to end. Things didn\u2019t go our way down the stretch a few times, but we stuck with it and didn\u2019t hang our heads. We kept making plays and went on to the next one. Just keep competing, playing with each other and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Miles Bridges continued to play well, posting 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting, five rebounds and three blocks. PJ Washington narrowly missed a double-double with 15 points and nine rebounds, while fellow frontcourter Bismack Biyombo had 13 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks for his eighth double-double of the campaign. Rookie Jalen McDaniels had nine points and seven rebounds off the bench and Cody Martin added four points, four rebounds and a career-high six assists. On the other side, All-Star starter Pascal Siakam racked up a game-high 24 points on just 9-of-23 shooting, nine rebounds, four assists and two steals for the host Raptors. Powell (22) and Lowry (21) also crossed the 20-point mark, while OG Anunoby chipped in 16 points, nine rebounds, three assists and a career-high six steals. Charlotte finished the night shooting 43.6% (43.3% from three; 13-of-30) against the NBA\u2019s second-ranked defensive unit and held the Raptors to a mere 34.7% from the field. The Hornets also overcame 18 turnovers for 23 Toronto points and won the rebounding battle by a decisive 58-45 margin. A four-game homestand tips off for the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday, March 1, when they play host to the Milwaukee Bucks starting at 1 PM EST.

Terry Rozier paved the way for the hosts with a game-high 26 points on 7-of-15 shooting and four assists in the victory, which was just the team\u2019s second in its last 12 appearances in Charlotte. After a day off, Devonte\u2019 Graham snapped out of his post-All-Star Break slump with another 21 points and a team-high five assists. Tied 45-45 with 4:48 left in the second quarter, the Hornets uncorked a 11-1 run to enter halftime with a 10-point advantage, which they sustained heading to the fourth as well. New York got the deficit down to two with 2:58 remaining before Charlotte responded with a back-and-forth 10-6 stretch highlighted by an acrobatic Rozier layup with 28 seconds left that essentially ran the clock out. \u201cI\u2019m most proud of the response after last night\u2019s [39-point loss in Indiana],\u201d said Coach Borrego afterwards. \u201cOn a back-to-back, we got beat pretty good [yesterday].

You have to move on,\u201d added Rozier. \u201cYou have to have short-term memory. Obviously, if you get beat how we did last night and get manhandled, it\u2019s in the back of your mind. That\u2019s something that we talked about today. Just tried to go out there, send a message, be the harder-playing team.

Charlotte is coming off a 119-80 loss in Indiana last night, an outing highlighted by a 17-point showing from second-year forward Miles Bridges. The Hornets will need to shake off one of the rougher performances of the season rather quickly at Spectrum Center, where they\u2019ve struggled an unusual amount as of late despite the presumably friendlier confines. \u201cFor some reason, we can\u2019t generate momentum here at home,\u201d said Borrego after last Saturday\u2019s 115-86 home loss to Brooklyn, the team\u2019s ninth in 10 outings in Charlotte. \u201cIt is on me and our group to keep looking at ways to play with more spirit, more fight here at home. For whatever reason, it really has started on the offensive end. We have not shot the ball or scored the ball well here at home, especially in the first half. We have to correct that.\u201d Charlotte leads the season series with New York, 2-0, and won the most recent meeting, 97-92 at home on Jan. 28, a victory which ended an eight-game slide. Terry Rozier had 30 points and 10 rebounds for the hosts, who also got points-rebounds double-doubles from Cody Zeller and Willy Hernang\u00f3mez. Julius Randle (24) and Marcus Morris Sr. (23) both crossed the 20-point plateau for the Knicks, who shot 28.1% from three and allowed 16 offensive rebounds. The Knicks recently flipped Morris Sr. to the LA Clippers in a three-team deal at the trade deadline that sent Moe Harkless and a first-round pick back to the Big Apple. Randle is leading the team in scoring (19.8 PPG on 46.5% shooting) and rebounding (10.8 RPG) since then, with Elfrid Payton (14.0 PPG and team-high 8.0 APG) and Mitchell Robinson (9.5 PPG on 81.3% shooting, 7.3 RPG and 2.8 BPG off the bench) also serving as consistent contributors. New York is riding a four-game losing streak after winning a season-best four straight games from Feb. 1-8. Two things that the Knicks do well though are rim protection (43.5 PPG allowed in paint, fourth fewest in the NBA) and rebounding (51.1% percentage is 10th), which means the Hornets will have to get the offense going early in order to space out this Knicks defense a bit. Game Notes: Knicks G Frank Ntilikina (bilateral groin soreness) and G Elfrid Payton (right ankle soreness) did not play for New York on Monday night\u2026 Charlotte has won three straight games against the Knicks and six of the last eight meetings overall.

The Yellow Ribbon Program recognizes one of these heroes during Hornets home games throughout the season.  Recipients are acknowledged prior to the national anthem and during an on-court presentation at halftime and given six tickets to the game.  In addition, the Hornets make a $1,000 donation to his or her charity of choice.  Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker has elected to split the donation between the Clerk of Court Guardian Ad Litem Charitable Fund and the Cape Fear Valley Foundation Friends of the Cancer Center. \u201cWe are honored to recognize Chief Warrant Officer 3 Edryce Tucker for her 21 years of service to our country and for breaking new ground for women serving in the United States Army,\u201d said Hornets Sports &amp; Entertainment President &amp; Vice Chairman Fred Whitfield.  \u201cHer dedication is evident throughout all aspects of her life \u2013 dedication to her country, to herself, to her family and to the children she has helped in Fayetteville.  The Hornets and Bank of America are pleased to have this opportunity to show our appreciation for all she has done. Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker enlisted in the United States Army in 1974 and served for 21 years before retiring in March 1995. Tucker began her service in the Women\u2019s Army Corps with basic training at Fort Jackson, where she believed she would have the opportunity to experience the same training as the male soldiers. She later found out her basic training unit was a test unit to determine whether women were mentally, emotionally and physically strong enough to become active members. After her time at Fort Jackson, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker was assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, where she was involved in another test program in which she entered an on-the-job training program with an all-male training unit at her permanent duty station rather than going to a military technical school to learn her military occupational skill.  In 1978, the Women\u2019s Army Corps was disbanded and all women were integrated with male units similar to the path she followed. During her 21 years of service, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker was assigned to bases in North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, along with two assignments to Germany.  During Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield, she and her husband were both stationed at Fort Bragg \u2013 she with the 44th Medical Brigade and he with the 82nd Airborne Division \u2013 and were both deployed within 30 days of each other. For her distinguished service, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker received the Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award), National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal (with two Bronze Service Stars), Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon (with Numeral 2), Meritorious Service Medal and the Kuwait Liberation Medal-Saudi Arabia. After retiring from the Army, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker began working as an administrative assistant with First Command Financial Services, where she learned about investments and assisted retired and active duty soldiers who were involved in investments. She completed an associate degree in sociology at Fayetteville Technical Community College, then earned a degree in social work with honors from Methodist University in May 1999.  During that time, she volunteered in the library at the Fayetteville Veterans Hospital and with Catholic Charities in their afterschool tutoring program.  Chief Warrant Officer 3 Tucker and her husband also became licensed foster parents and she later provided respite care for other foster parents for two years while her husband was reassigned to Germany.  In addition, she began to volunteer as a Guardian Ad Litem for children going through the court system who were removed from their families due to neglect or abuse.

Bridges streak of 10+ points extended to 10 games - the longest such streak of his career. The Nets were able to handle the Hornets both inside and outside in this one, outshooting Charlotte 36.2 percent (17-of-47) to 34.3 percent (12-of-35) from long range and holding a 50-36 advantage in points in the paint. Things began to unravel for the Hornets late in the third quarter as the Nets rattled off a 19-6 run in the last 4:33 of the third quarter to more than double their 12-point lead and take an 88-63 advantage into the fourth on the Hornets home court. Charlotte would finish the third quarter getting outshot 57.1 percent (12-of-21) to 35.0 percent (7-of-20) from the field, including 60.0 percent (6-of-10) to 16.7 percent (1-of-6) from long range. Not only were the Hornets outshot in the third, but they were out hustled, getting outrebounded 11-9 while turning the ball over four times, leading to seven Nets points. Charlotte, meanwhile, forced two Brooklyn turnovers that it turned into no points. Sparked by Washington\u2019s hot play in the second half, the Hornets kept things interesting in the fourth but were not able to cut the lead to single digits on the way to the loss. Timothy Luwawu-Cabarrot led all scorers with 21 points off the bench for Brooklyn, while eight different Nets finished scoring in double figures. The Hornets now head to Indiana where they tip off at 7 p.m. on Tuesday against the Pacers. Watch the game on Fox Sports Southeast or the Hornets app. Listen on WFNZ and the Hornets app as well. "}

After winning their previous three games (all on the road), the Hornets fell at home to the Brooklyn Nets, 115-86, last Saturday night. Charlotte struggled to generate much offense (35.2% shooting from the field) and control the boards (54-45 differential), two things it\u2019ll need to rectify in tonight\u2019s matchup with the Eastern Conference\u2019s sixth-best team. \u201cWe\u2019ve played well on the road,\u201d said Coach Borrego following Monday\u2019s workout in Charlotte. \u201cIf we can rebound and run, it\u2019s going to generate some more offense for us. We\u2019re going to have to generate good looks. Indiana is a very good half-court defensive team and they\u2019ve been that for a number of years. We have to get out and run and to do that, we have to get stops.\u201d Indiana leads the season series, 2-1, and has taken the last two meetings, the most recent coming in Charlotte on Jan. 6 by a score of 115-104. TJ Warren had a season-high 36 points (also had a 33-point showing at Spectrum Center on Nov. 5) and All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis compiled 18 points and 12 rebounds in the win. Terry Rozier (28) and Devonte\u2019 Graham (22) each had 20-point outings for the hosts, while also dishing out six assists apiece. The Pacers enter tonight\u2019s game having lost seven of nine and are coming off a 46-point road loss to Toronto on Sunday evening. Sabonis is averaging 19.7 PPG on 54.3% shooting, 10.9 RPG and an impressive 5.9 APG across this stretch, while Victor Oladipo has struggled in his return from a year-long absence because of a ruptured quadriceps tendon (11.0 PPG on 34.1% shooting and 2.4 APG; appeared in seven of the nine outings with five starts). Indiana still sits fourth in the league in turnovers (12.4) and fifth in points allowed off turnovers per game (14.7). The Hornets\u2019 offense is at its best when in transition and the pace is moving quickly, so generating extra possessions on the defensive end will be a key factor in possibly picking up another road win at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Game Notes: Pacers G Jeremy Lamb (torn right ACL, torn lateral meniscus and lateral femoral condylar fracture) was ruled out for the season on Monday afternoon\u2026 Charlotte has dropped six of its seven regular season appearances in Indiana since the start of the 2016-17 NBA campaign.

Charlotte opened its post-All-Star Break schedule with a 103-93 road triumph over the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night, getting a combined 47 points from Malik Monk (25) and Miles Bridges (22) in the process. The Bulls whittled a 21-point third-quarter deficit down to just two with about 14 minutes remaining, but the Hornets stayed composed and pulled away in the end. \u201cI\u2019d say it was mature, resilient,\u201d said Coach Borrego after Friday\u2019s practice back in Charlotte. \u201cYou have to battle through the different adversities throughout an NBA game. It\u2019s a long 48-minute game, but I thought the maturity showed in the fourth quarter. There was immaturity in the third quarter \u2013 we talked about it at halftime. I thought we responded maturely.\u201d Brooklyn leads the season series with Charlotte, 2-1, although squandered a 20-point lead at home in their most recent meeting back on Dec. 11 in route to a 113-108 loss. Devonte\u2019 Graham scored a career-high 40 points (7-of-12 from three) and Bridges added another 14 points in what stands as the Hornets\u2019 largest comeback victory of the campaign. Spencer Dinwiddie (24) and Jarrett Allen (21) each had 20-point outings for Brooklyn in the loss. The Nets have won four of their last six outings, ranking 12th in the NBA in offensive rating (113.6) and a stingy second in defensive rating (102.9) during this stretch. Kyrie Irving hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 1 (right shoulder impingement), so Caris LeVert (21.6 PPG; 47.1% from three), Dinwiddie (18.4 PPG and 7.6 APG) and Joe Harris (16.0 PPG; 43.9% from three) have all picked up the slack offensively across this aforementioned six-outing span. Brooklyn ended up ruling Irving out for the season on Thursday afternoon, but the team actually has a better record without (17-17) the six-time All-Star this season then it does with him (8-12). Thanks to big bodies like Allen, Taurean Prince and DeAndre Jordan, the Nets sit second in the NBA in rebounding percentage (55.8%) across their 4-2 stretch, making the battle on the boards a critical one tonight in the season series finale. Game Notes: Brooklyn has lost four of its last five road appearances, although the Hornets have dropped eight of their last nine games at Spectrum Center\u2026 A win tonight would mark Charlotte\u2019s first four-game winning streak since April 3-9, 2019.

My role involves helping to develop the training processes, the recruiting and employer relations. I support the recruiting process, so bringing in all of our staff, including full-time, part-time and interns. Without them \u2013 especially our part-time employees and interns \u2013 our organization wouldn\u2019t run as well as it does. I work and help support programs like Buzz City U, which is a series of internal developmental classes and workshops for our employees. I also assist with different projects like onboarding, employee engagement, developing handbooks and making sure our policies and procedures are in place.\u201d What experience(s) have had the most significant impact on your career in sports? \u201cA few years ago, I had some family struggles with my sister and my niece, which led to them being homeless. My sister is completely self-sufficient now, but watching the non-profit organizations help her get to the point of sustainability had a huge impact on me. I knew from that point on that I wanted to be one of those people who helped others. I went into that field for a bit after studying non-profit management in graduate school before I realized there were little opportunities for growth at the nonprofit that I was working for at the time. That\u2019s when I started to think about what I could do and still be able to help people in my career. That\u2019s when I landed in Human Resources.\u201d What does Black History Month mean to you? \u201cFor me, Black History Month is just a small time period in the year where we get to recognize changes in not only the Black community, but in the world that were inspired by those in the Black community. We recognize the bigger leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and people like that, but also the smaller names of people we don\u2019t hear about as much or ever. If that one random woman in the grocery store that one day started a whole movement, then we can be a part of it as well no matter what color we are.\u201d How do you see yourself as a role model in the Black community? \u201cComing from the non-profit background especially, one thing that is huge for me is generational wealth. I teach that to my friends, family members, little cousins, siblings, anyone and everyone who will listen. I explain the importance of retirement, a budget, working more than just a part-time job because you don\u2019t want to work for the rest of your life. I try to spread my knowledge and show people if I can manage my budget and pay my bills on time, others can as well.\u201d \u201cFor example, saving for larger purchases and rainy days is a huge factor in ending this vicious cycle of poverty. Things like comparing benefit plans when picking a job is something a lot of people (not just in the Black community) don\u2019t know how to do or realize they don\u2019t know how to do it. Making them aware and giving them the resources and knowledge to make an informed decision is critical whenever the time comes to get a job offer, prepare for a child that\u2019s on the way or buy a home in the future.\u201d Who are the most influential Black role models in your life? \u201cPersonally, it would absolutely be my grandmother, Mary, who I call my Nana. She pretty much raised me and was always the person who said, \u2018Don\u2019t say you can\u2019t. You always can. Maybe it\u2019s not working out the way you planned, but there\u2019s a reason for that. Go after whatever you want and figure it out along the way. Don\u2019t be afraid to take chances if it\u2019s what you want to do.\u2019 Those simple words were such a big deal to me because I\u2019ve seen parents discourage their children from going after what they want, even something beneficial like going across the country to attend college or doing a study abroad program. Things like that would broaden your experiences in life, but sometimes parents keep their children from doing that because of their own fears. My grandmother is a fearless woman and she instilled that in me. I don\u2019t think I would be anywhere close to where I am today without her.\u201d "}

Although it was ultimately an exhibition event, that didn\u2019t stop the Hornets forward from showing out to the tune of 20 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in route to being named the organization\u2019s first-ever MVP at the competition. \u201cI really just wanted to go out and have fun,\u201d said Bridges, who became the first second-year player to garner the award after not making the game as a rookie since Kenneth Faried in 2013. \u201cOnce I got in a rhythm, I felt like I was going to get MVP. I wasn\u2019t really planning anything. Hopefully, I can do something with the trophy, like putting it in a nice little case.\u201d Across his previous eight (regular season) outings, Bridges was averaging a team-high 19.6 PPG on 46.8% shooting, 6.5 RPG and 1.1 APG. Those numbers stood at 11.9 PPG on 43.4% shooting, 5.4 RPG and 1.8 APG over his first 46 appearances of the campaign, all but one of which were starts. He\u2019s also getting to the free-throw line over twice as often (1.6 to 3.5) as of late and connecting on close to 80.0% of such attempts. \u201cMiles has been growing throughout the season and even through the lows of the season for him, he\u2019s stayed aggressive,\u201d said Coach Borrego. \u201cHe\u2019s stayed positive and we\u2019ve stayed positive with him. These are young men trying to figure this out. It goes in waves. Sometimes you\u2019re up, sometimes you\u2019re down, but this kid\u2019s playing with a lot of consistency right now.\u201d \u201cI do believe he has turned a corner. I absolutely do. I see it in his eyes. I can feel him. He\u2019s different to me. He\u2019s matured and I think he understands his game in a better light right now. He\u2019s attacking the rim, playing off the bounce, attacking the board on both sides. He\u2019s defending at a high level. I just like his overall mentality right now.\u201d Bridges\u2019 ability to finish at the rim lately has been the main root of his increased scoring output. He\u2019s currently shooting 73.2% in the restricted area during this eight-outing stretch, a significant improvement from the 62.7% clip he posted over the previous 46 games. The Michigan State product has also connected on 10-of-20 corner threes in these eight games (50.0%), after going 26-of-69 leading up to them (37.7%). \u201cI\u2019m just being more aggressive with offensive rebounding, making the right plays on offense and my defense has really gotten going, too,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make things easier on myself. I was doing a lot of one-legged hook shots, shooting difficult shots, all that type of stuff. Now, I just feel like I\u2019m taking my time going off two feet and using my strengths as advantages.\u201d \u201cI just think Miles has gotten a lot more aggressive,\u201d added Devonte\u2019 Graham, who in addition to PJ Washington, also played in the Rising Stars Challenge. \u201cHe\u2019s playing with that confidence and when you get a couple games like he\u2019s had, it starts to build. He\u2019s one of the big keys for us defensively because he can guard one through four, even one through five. When he brings that energy defensively and is knocking down shots, it gets us going, for sure.\u201d The soon-to-be 22-year old has an offensive rating of 108.0 and a defensive rating of 110.1 since Jan. 28, efficiency metrics that respectively stood at 102.5 and 115.5 beforehand. And while Bridges\u2019 recent honoring came in a mostly defense-optional exhibition showcase, it can still serve as a confidence boost heading into the final 28 games of the season. \u201cI think [Miles, Devonte\u2019 and PJ] all came in with a different swagger,\u201d added Borrego. \u201cThey experienced what that special weekend looks like. They want to get to Sunday though and play in the final game. This allowed them to see that stage and what that looks like. Now, it\u2019s about working and putting in the work to get better, to keep climbing. Overall, it should give Miles and all these young men confidence heading into this final stretch.\u201d While the glitz and glamour of All-Star Weekend was fun and well-deserved, it\u2019s now in the rearview mirror. The current Hornets rotation is as young as it\u2019s been in quite some time and Bridges says leadership and continued aggression and confidence will be keys to finishing the campaign on a high note. \u201cI feel like everybody has to be a leader on this team in order to be successful. It\u2019s on everybody. Now, it\u2019s time to get back to the serious stuff. I just need to continue to stay aggressive and make the right plays.\u201d "}

Having dropped the previous five outings before this two-game stretch, the pair of victories gave the Hornets a bit of momentum heading into the seven-day layoff and now, they\u2019re hungry for more. \u201cIt\u2019s great.

Malik Monk led the visitors with a game-high 25 points on 7-of-13 shooting (career-best 9-of-9 from the free-throw line), six rebounds and three assists. And fresh off winning the Rising Stars Challenge MVP last Friday night in the exact same building, Miles Bridges added another 22 points, eight rebounds, two assists and two steals in the victory.

The whole experience has been a blessing.\u201d Hield is the first Sacramento Kings player to win the competition since Peja Stojakovi\u0107 took home back-to-back titles in 2002 and 2003. Originally from the Bahamas, Hield is also the first foreign-born player to win the 3-Point Contest since Marco Belinelli in 2014. Booker narrowly missed becoming the event\u2019s first multi-time winner since Jason Kapono in 2008. Graham and the rest of the Charlotte Hornets will be back in action at the United Center next Thursday, Feb. 20, when they face the Chicago Bulls starting at 8 PM EST.

Second-year guard and Most Improved Player candidate Devonte\u2019 Graham is averaging 18.1 PPG and 7.8 APG (seventh in the NBA) so far this season, while also knocking down the fifth-most total three-pointers (185). Fellow 2018 draftee Miles Bridges has been on a tear lately, putting up 19.6 PPG on 46.8% shooting and 6.5 RPG over his past eight games. Last but not lease, forward PJ Washington currently ranks 11th amongst rookies in scoring (11.7 PPG), fourth in rebounding (5.5), ninth in assists (2.2) and steals (0.9) and sixth in blocks (0.8). \u201cThis validates what we\u2019re doing and our development program, the guys we\u2019re bringing in, the characters, the athletes, the IQ,\u201d said Coach Borrego. \u201cI think it\u2019s all positive. We\u2019re trending the right way. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, but to be validated like this speaks to these players and their work ethic and to our organization as a whole. I\u2019m proud of them. They\u2019re going to represent us very well out there and enjoy it. I think it\u2019ll raise their bar, their standard being around those great players. That\u2019s where they should want to be every single All-Star Break.\u201d Team USA won last year\u2019s meeting with Team World, 161-144, in Charlotte, which moved its Rising Stars Challenge record to 2-3 since this particular format was first implemented in 2015. Los Angeles Lakers F Kyle Kuzma was named MVP after racking up a game-high 35 points, six rebounds and two assists in just 22 minutes of playing time. Memphis F Jaren Jackson Jr. and Atlanta G Trae Young are the only returning members from Team USA\u2019s victorious 2019 squad. Dallas G Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (Slovenia), Oklahoma City G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada) and Minnesota G Josh Okogie (Nigeria) are all looking for revenge after finding themselves on the losing end last year. Coming into tonight\u2019s showdown, Young is the leading scorer (29.7 PPG) and assists generator (9.2) for Team USA. New Orleans F Zion Williamson is averaging 21.0 PPG and a team-best 7.7 RPG (although has played just nine games this year) and Memphis G Ja Morant has also looked quite impressive with marks of 17.6 PPG and 7.1 APG in his first NBA campaign. Don\u010di\u0107, who is also starting for Team LeBron in the All-Star Game on Sunday night, is tops on Team World in scoring (28.9 PPG), rebounding (9.5) and assists (8.7 APG).

This will be Graham\u2019s first time participating in the competition and the fifth occurrence of a Charlotte Hornet player doing so overall (none of the previous four have ever won it). The second-year guard finished with nine points in last night\u2019s Rising Stars Challenge game, all of which came in the second half on 3-of-5 shooting from distance. \u201cThat first half I was struggling shooting, but then I got to it in the second half,\u201d he said after the game, which Team USA won, 151-131. \u201cThat got me going a little bit and gave me a little confidence going into the Three-Point Contest.\u201d Joining Graham in the event will be returning participants Devin Booker (Phoenix; fourth time), Buddy Hield (Sacramento; second time), Joe Harris (Brooklyn, second time) and newcomers Trae Young (Atlanta), Duncan Robinson (Miami), Zach LaVine (Chicago) and D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns (Washington). Each of the eight players will have 70 seconds to shoot from five racks of five balls each spaced out around the arc, with the final \u201cmoney ball\u201d in each rack counting as two makes instead of one. Competitors will choose one specific rack to be entirely money balls and this year, there will be a pair of shots from six feet behind the three-point line worth another three points each. All added up, players can score a maximum of 40 points in the opening round. The top three finishers will advance and then shoot again in reverse order of first-round score in order to determine a champion. An additional full round of shooting will be implemented in case of a tie at any point. Harris is the reigning champ and was also last year\u2019s regular season three-point percentage leader (47.4%). Hield finished third behind Harris and Steph Curry at the 2019 Three-Point Contest, one year after Booker took home the crown out in Los Angeles. Six players have won the event multiple times and nobody has gone back-to-back since Jason Kapono in 2006-07. Look for Graham to use that all-money rack anywhere from the second to fourth stations. Of the 9.4 three-point attempts he takes per game this season, 8.7 are coming from above the break. On corner threes, he\u2019s connected on 12-of-32 overall attempts (37.5%) and notably holds a 44.4% conversion rate from the right corner (8-of-18) Going into the All-Star Break, Graham ranks sixth amongst the eight competitors in three-point percentage (37.4%), although is second in attempts (508; fourth-highest total overall in the NBA) behind only Hield (537). He sits in long-distance makes (190), behind only James Harden (234), Damian Lillard (212), Hield (207) and Robinson (191). "}

The second-year forward finished with 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in 20 minutes off the bench in the win. Bridges is now the first player in franchise history to ever garner MVP honors at this particular event and joins Glen Rice as the only Hornet to bring home All-Star Weekend hardware of any kind (1997 All-Star Game MVP). \u201cI really just wanted to come out and have fun, enjoy the guys, and put on a show for the fans,\u201d said Bridges afterwards. \u201cI mean, I'm happy I got the MVP. I really thought Eric Paschall or Collin Sexton was going to get it because they had more points than me, but I'm happy I got it too. Team World led by nine after the opening 10 minutes, eventually inching the advantage to double figures with an 81-71 halftime lead. Out of the break, Bridges (13), Devonte\u2019 Graham (6) and PJ Washington (2) combined to score 21 of Team USA\u2019s 44 third-quarter points, swinging the lead to 115-105 in favor of the Americans. Team World never led again after that, dropping its second straight Rising Stars outing. Graham finished with nine points on 3-of-7 shooting from three, six rebounds and five assists, while PJ Washington had eight points on 4-of-5 shooting, five rebounds and two assists. Eric Paschall (23), Collin Sexton (21), Trae Young (18), Kendrick Nunn (16), Zion Williamson (14), Jaren Jackson Jr. (12) and Ja Morant (10) made it eight Team USA scorers in double figures. \u201cReal fun,\u201d added Washington. \u201cWe picked it up out there and didn\u2019t give up. It just shows how much we want to win and how much effort we can put into this game. Miles played his butt off. Made shots, had some crazy dunks and played defense as well. I\u2019m excited for him and just really happy we got the win.\u201d On the international side, Canadian RJ Barrett tallied a game-high 27 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals in the loss. Brandon Clarke (22), Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (16), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (16), Moritz Wagner (16) and Rui Hachimura (14) all cracked the 10-point barrier as well. Team USA finished the night shooting 62.7% from the field (17-of-39 from three; 43.6%), outscoring Team World, 80-50, over the final two quarters. Team World went just 12-of-49 from distance (24.5%) and edged the Americans on the boards, 44-43 (14-7 advantage in offensive boards). Washington and Bridges have now wrapped up their All-Star Weekend responsibilities, while Graham is back in action tomorrow for the Three-Point Contest as part of NBA All-Star Saturday night beginning at 8 PM EST at the United Center.

As a team we also do the finance and accounting for not only the Charlotte Hornets but also the Greensboro Swarm, Hornets Venom GT, Arena operations and the Hornets Foundation. One of my primary tasks is supporting the sponsorship team in billing and AR accounting, I also support team store accounting along with the Foundation along with bunch of other things. There are six of us on the finance team and while we each have things that we focus on, we are also an all-hands-on-deck finance team which is something that I truly appreciate. We make sure all the numbers are right for the Hornets Organization.\u201d What experience(s) have had the most significant impact on your career in sports? \u201cI ended up in finance just by default. My first job out of high school, I worked for HSBC Bank where I worked my way up from a data entry clerk to consumer finance during college over a period of 10 years, but it wasn\u2019t always where I saw my career going. I tried some other career aspirations and then defaulted back to finance. Before joining the Hornets, I worked for another company where I was this small piece of a huge, multi-billion-dollar machine. I had been there for a month and I got a call from a recruiter about a job with the Bobcats. I took the interview on my lunch and I remember the feeling of liking a smaller team and the Bobcats finance people saying they would teach me everything they knew. They took a chance on me and helped me move along in my career. I\u2019ve now been here 10 years, but that was the biggest turning point, for sure.\u201d What does Black History Month mean to you? \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of black history in this country. You can have an appreciation for this month and recognize the contributions and accomplishments of African-Americans, but at the same time, it needs to be done throughout the entire year. I understand as people of color, we haven\u2019t always gotten our recognition or just due. We started having to become our own cheerleaders and tell our own stories. I understand the need for BHM because minorities or people of color, their history has been lost, and although that narrative is beginning to change, we do need to celebrate. It\u2019s all a part of American history. It\u2019s important to celebrate because it\u2019s the time we do get the light shined on things people of color have contributed, what we\u2019ve accomplished, changes that have been brought forth, so we can live the way we live today. As we move forward, how do we extend it all the way out to making it about American history? We have power and control over the narrative of black history. Our stories are being told a lot more in movies like \u2018The Best of Enemies\u2019, \u2018Harriet\u2019 or \u2018Hidden Figures.\u2019 You start to see those things come out, ultimately we need to continue bringing these stories to light.\u201d How do you see yourself as a role model in the African-American community? \u201cI am member of my sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, which I joined at the University of Buffalo. We were founded on January 13th, 1913 built upon Sisterhood, Scholarship and Service with emphasis on public service in our communities. One of our first public service acts as an organization was the Women\u2019s Suffrage March which took place on March 3rd 1913. Through my sorority, I\u2019m able to focus on our public service initiatives, things like physical and mental health, political awareness and involvement, economic development, educational development and international awareness and involvement. We have programs and community service events which revolve around these initiatives that I am actively involved in. I understand that if I\u2019m doing something out in the community where I have my sorority letters on, people see me more and wonder what we\u2019re up to. I recognize that eyes are on me and how we portray ourselves in the community. You have the ability to create an impact, make an influence on what our organization and I\u2019m about.\u201d One of my favorite quotes which reflects the above is, \u201cIf you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together\u201d. \u201cBecoming part of our organization is a lifetime commitment. Once you graduate from college you join the Alumnae chapter of the city or community in which you live. It is the collective efforts of women who are already servants and activists in their community that makes what we do as an organization possible. It\u2019s not the letters that make the women but the women who serve the letters. My daughter watched me since she was a little girl be involved with my beloved organization and she has followed in my footsteps. Other women have come up to me and said I\u2019m the reason they wanted to join this organization. I just try and make the best impact and use my opportunities to make this world a better place.\u201d Are there any influential African-American role models in your life? \u201cOne person that has always stuck with me since I was younger was a teacher by the name of Wadine Murphy, who is also one of my sorority sisters. She was my sixth-grade teacher at a school called Campus East who has been ingrained in my memory because she pushed me to be the best and to get myself in line.\u201d \u201cGrowing up, I had a tough time. I was half black, half white and living in a predominantly white neighborhood. I really had a struggle from both sides and didn\u2019t fit in or belong anywhere. I was born two years after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, so we were still heavily in segregation times. I was going to a magnet school that was 50% white and 50% black and I was right in the middle. On top of that, I\u2019m adopted so, I\u2019m not even with my birth parents. Mrs. Murphy took me under her wing and got me back in a line with convincing me I was smart, a good student and needed to stay focused. She got me into doing the Richmond Speaking Contest where I recited Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s \u2018I Have a Dream Speech\u2019 and I won! She\u2019s just always stuck with me in the back of my mind.\u201d After I joined my sorority, I was able to find Mrs. Murphy and greet her as my Soror and let her know that she\u2019s had a huge impact on my life. She redirected me from the path I was going down.\u201d "}

The Hornets began their two-game road trip with a much-needed 87-76 win over the Pistons on Monday evening. Miles Bridges (18 points), Malik Monk (17 points) and Devonte\u2019 Graham (14 points and 11 assists) all had strong individual shows in the outing, but ultimately it was the defense that sealed the victory for the purple and teal. \u201cWe have to keep being physical,\u201d said Graham on Tuesday in Minneapolis. \u201cI feel like everybody was talking with each other, helping each other, coming over and taking charges, getting deflections. We just have to rebound better and we\u2019ll be better off on defense. [Minnesota] brought in some good pieces, some young guys to put around the guys they already had.

Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 37 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists, four steals and two blocks, helping the visitors compile a 45-point third quarter in the process, which was ultimately the turning point of the contest. This will be much different-looking Minnesota team this time around though after the organization added nine new players at the trade deadline, most notably D\u2019Angelo Russell in a swap with Golden State for Andrew Wiggins. Russell had 23 points, five assists and six turnovers in his debut on Monday in Toronto, Towns is averaging 26.4 PPG over his past 12 outings and newcomer Malik Beasley has put up 19.0 PPG while shooting 47.4% from distance in two appearances. With so much recent turnover, Minnesota is still figuring out its identity, but has glaringly drained a staggering 44-of-84 three-point attempts over the past two outings (52.4%). The Hornets did a great job of running the Pistons off the line in Detroit (7-of-35) and will have to do so again if they want back-to-back wins heading into the All-Star Break.

The hosts also committed 21 turnovers leading to 24 points for the Hornets, although won the rebounding battle, 52-45 (19-13 edge in offensive boards). \u201cI didn\u2019t see us hanging our heads as much tonight,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cWe kept digging in, kept getting stops, running. I thought the spirit stayed with us all night. Even though shots weren\u2019t falling, we didn\u2019t hang our heads. We kept playing.\u201d The pre-All-Star Break schedule closes out for the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, Feb. 12, when they face the Minnesota Timberwolves starting at 8 PM EST at Target Center.

The front of the purple T-shirt features the Dreamville logo, accented by a classic Hornets logo, in white.\u00a0 The back features a full-color classic Hornets logo with Hugo wearing a Dreamville hoodie.\u00a0 The use of the classic logo ties to the game being a Retro Remix Night, when the Hornets wear purple Classic Edition uniforms and play on their classic court, while the fan experience incorporates music and pop culture of the mid to late-1990s when the team first wore the purple uniforms. \u201cWe are excited to collaborate with Dreamville Records to give away a co-branded T-shirt for our March 7 game,\u201d said Hornets President &amp; Vice Chairman Fred Whitfield.\u00a0 \u201cAs North Carolina\u2019s NBA team, we are pleased to have the opportunity to partner with one of our state\u2019s most prominent performers in J.

Lute recently released his single, \u201cGED (Gettin Every Dolla),\u201d which is the first solo venture the Grammy-nominated artist has had since his album\u00a0West 1996 pt. 2, in 2017.

Cole and fellow Charlottean DaBaby. \"I think that this Dreamville and Hornets collab is really dope and would mean a lot to the city and the culture,\" said Lute. \"Growing up, I remember the Hornets would always connect with people in the community; whether it be players shooting hoops with kids at the park or your favorite player coming to the barbershop. It's a fitting collab because we share the same principles.\u201d Dreamville Records was founded by Grammy Award-winning artist and producer J. Cole and is distributed through Interscope Records, a unit of Universal Music Group.\u00a0 Since launching the label, Cole has also established the Dreamville Foundation, a nonprofit in his hometown of Fayetteville, NC, as well as the Dreamville Festival, which will take place this year on April 4 at Raleigh\u2019s Dorothea Dix Park and benefits the Dreamville Foundation and the Dix Park Conservancy.

Hours earlier, veterans Marvin Williams and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist were placed on waivers, another clear sign of the organization\u2019s youth-driven direction. The recent loss of leadership aside, Coach Borrego was adamant about how important each game moving forward is as the second half of the schedule unfolds. \u201cThis is a critical 30 games for us moving forward, 30 games of high-level experience and evaluation and we\u2019re going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get creative and there\u2019s going to be a lot of young guys moving through the rotation and figuring it out and it will be a great challenge for all of us. We are going to move forward and evaluate and have some great experience for these young guys, but we have to do it the right way and play the right way.\u201d The Hornets have won nine straight against the Pistons and the three meetings this season have been decided by a grand total of just seven points. Charlotte rallied from 10 down midway through the fourth to claim a 110-107 victory in Detroit on Nov. 29, hitting 19-of-38 three-pointers in the process (50.0%). PJ Washington led the visitors with 26 points and four steals and Derrick Rose had 23 points on 8-of-12 shooting off the bench for the hosts. With Andre Drummond now in Cleveland and Blake Griffin done for the year, the Pistons have turned their frontcourt over to Christian Wood, Thon Maker and rookie Sekou Doumbouya. Wood is averaging an impressive 18.6 PPG on 53.0% shooting (45.5% from three), 8.0 RPG and 1.2 SPG over his last five outings (two starts) and veteran guard Reggie Jackson is currently riding a three-game streak of 20+ points (24.3 PPG and 7.0 APG). Detroit has dropped nine of 12 outings, ranking 25th in the NBA in net rating (-4.9) during this stretch, although is fifth overall this season in three-point percentage (37.1%). The Hornets are conceding an average of 15.4 threes on 39.7% shooting over their last five games (all losses), so guarding the line will be imperative if they want to christen the trip with a much-needed win. Game Notes: Detroit G Luke Kennard (bilateral knee patella tendonitis) has not played since Dec. 23. Svi Mykhailiuk (right hip strain) and Derrick Rose (left hip adductor strain) have each missed the last four games\u2026 Charlotte has not lost to Detroit since a 102-90 road defeat on Oct. 18, 2017.

{"team": "hornets", "url": "https://www.nba.com/hornets/perleys-press-pass-monk-credits-recent-play-growing-taking-responsibility", "date": "2020-02-11 00:00:00", "tags": ["Monk, Malik", "Hornets", "Perley's Press Pass"], "article": " Over the past three weeks, Malik Monk has quietly been one of the efficiently productive bench scorers in the entire NBA. The third-year guard has had similar hot stretches before in his professional career, but nothing to this extent. It seems like the light has turned on for Monk and only burning brighter and brighter with youth becoming a heavier focus for the Hornets organization moving forward. \u201cI really just had to grow up and think about what can help the team when Devonte\u2019 or Terry aren\u2019t scoring,\u201d said Monk. \u201cMiles can\u2019t do everything, Cody can\u2019t do everything, so somebody else has to step up. I\u2019m coming off the bench and we need somebody to bring that energy. We need somebody with a lot of juice and I\u2019ve really just put it in my mind that it\u2019s going to be me. I really have to just come out and perform at a high level if we have any chance to win.\u201d What\u2019s perhaps most encouraging this season has been Monk\u2019s improved attentiveness to his off-the-court habits, areas that aren\u2019t abnormal for younger players to overlook. Ultimately though, few NBAers are truly good enough to get by on just talent and athleticism alone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t putting that much effort into the game,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWasn\u2019t watching film, all the little things, I wasn\u2019t doing them. I wasn\u2019t breaking down the other team\u2019s defense as much as I needed to be. I wasn\u2019t looking at all my shots as much as I needed to be. This year, I grew up and really just took responsibility for myself by doing those things.\u201d As for watching film specifically, he added, \u201cYou know where the defense is going to be at. You know where a better shot is going to be at. You know where your teammates are going to be. You\u2019ll know how the defense moves, you\u2019ll know how your teammates move, so it really all plays a part in just looking at the little things.\u201d After being benched for the team\u2019s Jan. 15 outing in Denver, Monk responded by averaging 16.4 PPG on 47.4% shooting, 3.6 RPG and 2.3 APG in nine games since. Only five other NBA players are putting up more points off the bench during this time frame (mini. nine games) and on the season, Monk is converting an impressive 63.8% of his shots within five feet of the basket (58.9% combined his first two seasons). Offensively, the only noticeable shortcoming Monk has right now is his three-point shooting, which stands at 27.9% on the season (although 37.1% during this aforementioned nine-game stretch). He\u2019s averaging a career low in long-distance attempts though (3.5) and unlike his first two campaigns, has been much more aggressive attacking the rim (6.2 drives per game; 4.0 previous two years combined) and not settling for long, sometimes contested shots.  \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of confidence right now,\u201d said Head Coach James Borrego after Monk scored 17 points in a road win over Detroit on Monday evening. \u201cHe\u2019s playing at a high level, attacking the rim, getting to the free-throw line, shooting his three with a lot more confidence, talking on the defensive end. There\u2019s been a lot of growth from him. I\u2019m really proud of him.\u201d Having just turned 22 years old last Tuesday, Monk is still relatively young by NBA standards. He\u2019s only six months older than rookie forward PJ Washington and younger than teammates Devonte\u2019 Graham, Dwayne Bacon, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin and Jalen McDaniels. \u201cI\u2019ve been so impressed with Malik,\u201d said former teammate Marvin Williams. \u201cEveryone in the world knows he can score. It\u2019s his growth on the defensive end, the way he goes about himself every day in the gym. He\u2019s lifting weights, making sure he\u2019s getting his shots, he\u2019s watching film. It\u2019s like night and day from when he first got here to now. You have to continue to get better all around. He\u2019s a gifted athlete and a gifted scorer. If you get him the ball, he knows what to do with it, but to see how he works on the defensive end individually and collectively with the team\u2019s schemes, he\u2019s gotten so, so much better.\u201d After being named the AP SEC Player of the Year and a Second-Team All-American at the conclusion of his lone season at Kentucky, were initial expectations a bit too high for the 11th overall pick Monk coming into the league? Probably, yes. He didn\u2019t have a set position coming out of college, was injured for his first Summer League and joined a team with imminent playoff aspirations. Progression and adaptability take time and not every player develops at the same rate, which in most cases, is perfectly alright. \u201cIt\u2019s what we signed up for,\u201d Williams added, the second overall pick in 2005. \u201cA lot of lottery picks go through it. I went through it. It\u2019s just part of it. I think Malik understands that and everybody that gets drafted in the lottery understands that. At the end of the day, we have to look ourselves in the mirror and say, \u2018Did we give it our all? Did we get better?\u2019 I think Malik has done that and he\u2019s definitely grown. With that being said, he just turned 22. His body will continue to mature, his game will get better. Malik\u2019s going to be a hell-of-a-player, for sure.\u201d Monk is by no means a finished product. He\u2019ll be the first to admit there\u2019s still a long way to go in order to reach where he wants to be both individually and collectively from a team standpoint. But a huge step has been taken in terms of physical and mental growth and with the youth movement in full effect, Malik Monk will be counted on more than ever over the final two months of the season.

All of our ticket plans \u2013 full season, half season, mini plans, six games \u2013 go through our department. We do individual games as well, like courtside seats, royal boxes, suites and premium seating in addition to concerts and shows at Spectrum Center.\u201d What experience(s) have had the most significant impact on your career in sports? \u201cWhen I was Indianapolis working for the NCAA, I was selling championships tickets for conference tournaments and March Madness. That was cool, but I wanted to be part of a team and not at a call center as much. I remember when I first started looking at the Hornets, meeting certain people was big for me and they became people I could look up to. They were in higher roles than me, but I could see myself in them. Director of Premium Memberships Services, Cedric Roberts, has certainly been a mentor to me. Seeing people who look like me in prominent roles in the NBA industry was something that was big.\u201d What does Black History Month mean to you? \u201cIt\u2019s a time to reflect and see where we are as people and how far we\u2019ve come from where we\u2019ve started. It\u2019s a chance to be appreciative of what we have and what I have that many people before me didn\u2019t have back in the day. There\u2019s a sense of pride that you represent something bigger than yourself. Coming to work every day, you realize there\u2019s people who really sacrificed for this. I remember when I used to ride the bus to come to work, I would always think about what it was like not being able to sit in the front. Some people went through a lot and not too long ago. My grandparents went through that. Overall, it\u2019s definitely a time of reflection and to be thankful.\u201d How do you see yourself as a role model in the Black community? \u201cI once had an appointment with a guy at the arena and his son came. His son thought I was one of the Hornets coaches. I was like, \u2018No, there\u2019s more ways to get into sports other than just playing or coaching.\u2019 For me, kids always look up to you, always ask you questions about how you got your job. It\u2019s cool to give the younger generation an example of what they can be. They can get to the same spot I\u2019m at and go further if they want. You don\u2019t have to be an athlete. You just have to be dedicated, work hard and you can get here, too.\u201d \u201cEven to the kids in my neighborhood, those are the ones I influence the most. I see them all the time and they think I\u2019m bigger than life because I\u2019m with the Hornets and the NBA. You\u2019re always representing something that\u2019s bigger than you and here, you\u2019re basically representing a little kid\u2019s dream. I definitely see myself as somebody people my age or my friends or young kids can look up to.\u201d \u201cMy little brother, Amari, plays sports and went to college for football. His main thing was to always try and get into sports for a living. I\u2019ve always been somebody that he could look up to and show him how our family operates and what our standards are. We\u2019re not going to mess around. We go to school, we go to work, we laugh, we play, we have fun, but we work hard. We\u2019re not doing what the other guys are doing in the neighborhood. We\u2019re doing something bigger than that. I\u2019m nine years older than him and he\u2019s always had no choice, but to look up to me. I don\u2019t want to ever have him look at me in a negative light. I want him to always have that same admiration for me. I\u2019ve got two little cousins now, too, one of which goes to Benedict College in South Carolina and the other is about to graduate. Being role models for them is important because I want something positive for them to look at.\u201d Are there any influential African-American role models in your life? \u201cDefinitely, my mother, Donna. I never knew my father, so it was just me, my mom and my little brother. My mom went to Florida A&amp;M, so I went to Florida A&amp;M. I\u2019ve watched how she moves, how she operates and how she doesn\u2019t take crap from anybody. She\u2019s laser focused. My auntie, Carlene, is another one. My mom works in the nursing field, but my auntie has a more corporate America job. To see how she\u2019s been able to rise and whenever I\u2019ve got a question about how she would handle a situation, she\u2019s always there. To see her as one of the directors at her company in Washington D.C. is amazing. They\u2019re the two most influential figures I know personally, who I talk to everyday about my life and where I\u2019m going.\u201d \u201cMy biggest role model as an African-American is definitely Muhammad Ali. He\u2019s my favorite athlete. His fights and trash talk were great and everything, but the biggest thing I love about Ali is how he stood up for what he believed in. He was willing to sacrifice what he loved to do the most for other people\u2019s rights. He gave up his championship, license to box and said, \u2018The Vietnam War isn\u2019t our war. It isn\u2019t something I believe in and I\u2019m not fighting in it.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t around back then, but I\u2019m sure if I was, I would have been a young kid saying the same thing. If he can go to jail and lose everything, then I can lose whatever I\u2019ve got, too. That attitude now, it\u2019s about not being afraid to stand up or fight for what you believe in. Live your life with a purpose. Don\u2019t just wake up and come to work. Have a reason for doing what you do.\u201d \u201cOne of our season ticket holders has also been very influential to me. Seeing a black man in his 50\u2019s, but making over $200,000 a year, has me sitting back like, \u2018Wow, I want to be like you when I get older.\u2019 I tell him that all the time. I want a beautiful wife, big huge ring on her finger. I want to be like him when I\u2019m his age. Since I\u2019ve moved here, he\u2019s definitely been somebody who has been really influential on my life and who I talk to all the time. "}

Devonte\u2019 Graham came alive late, finishing with a team-high 26 points on 10-of-20 shooting (14 points in the fourth quarter), four rebounds and a game-high 10 assists. This marked Graham\u2019s 15th double-double of the season and second in as many outings. Dallas shot 54.5% from the field in the first 12 minutes, knocking down 4-of-8 attempts from three in route to a 31-10 lead. Charlotte went just 4-of-24 (16.7%), matching its third-lowest first-quarter output at home in franchise history. The Hornets were a bit more consistent the rest of the way, although the early hole was simply too much to overcome in the long run. \u201cI wish I knew,\u201d said Coach Borrego when asked about the reason behind the slow start. \u201cI can sit and speculate all day long. The reality is we just had a bad first quarter. We scored 10 points in a quarter. That\u2019s going to be a tough grind to get back into that game. Disappointing start, I can\u2019t explain it. We have to be better. We own it and take responsibility for it.\u201d Miles Bridges had 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting, extending his 15-point game streak to a career-long six games. Malik Monk continued his strong play with 19 points in 28 minutes off the bench and Terry Rozier was also in double figures with 15 points and six rebounds. Rookie Jalen McDaniels \u2013 recently recalled from the G League \u2013 added another five points and two rebounds off the bench, finishing with a team-best +13 plus-minus. Of note, both Marvin Williams and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist were released earlier in the day. \u201cWe all felt [the absence] on the bench, in the locker room,\u201d Borrego added. \u201cThis is our challenge in front of us. That\u2019s where other people have to step up, learn, grow, take on the challenge, don\u2019t shy away from it. We got it out of our system in that first quarter and settled down a little. Seth Curry finished with 26 points on 10-of-14 shooting (6-of-8 from three) and six rebounds to lead the way for Dallas. Willie Cauley-Stein double-doubled with 15 points on a perfect 7-of-7 shooting and 10 rebounds, while Tim Hardaway Jr. (14), Dorian Finney-Smith (13), Jalen Brunson (13) and Boban Marjanovi\u0107 (11) made it seven Mavericks in double-figure scoring. Dallas finished the night shooting 50.6% from the field and a red-hot 48.6% from three-point range (17-of-35). The Mavericks also won the board, 46-39 and outscored Charlotte in bench points by a wide 54-27 gap.

Tomorrow\u2019s going to be a different game with two different teams playing on our floor.\u201d With Don\u010di\u0107 sidelined since Jan. 31 (right ankle sprain; not expected to play tonight), Kristaps Porzingis is averaging 35.0 PPG on 53.3%, 12.0 RPG and 1.7 SPG over his past three appearances. Jalen Brunson (15.8 PPG), Seth Curry (15.5 PPG), Tim Hardaway Jr. (15.3) and Dorian Finney-Smith (13.5 PPG) are also averaging double figures since Don\u010di\u0107 went down. Dallas still sits atop the league in offensive rating (115.9), although has the third-worst net rating (-18.6) in clutch time this season (score is within five with five minutes to go). Following solid performances against Orlando and Houston, things are starting to click for the Hornets and if they can keep it close down the stretch, they\u2019ll have a great chance of pulling off the season sweep against the Mavericks. Game Notes: Dallas F Dwight Powell (right Achilles surgery) and Charlotte G Cody Martin (nasal fracture/concussion protocol) are out for tonight\u2019s game\u2026 Dallas plays in Washington on Friday night. Porzingis (facial injury), Curry (left knee tightness) and JJ Barea (left ankle sprain) were all questionable for the game\u2026 Porzingis has made four out of eight possible appearances in the second leg of back-to-backs this season\u2026 The Hornets have just one season sweep of the Mavericks since the 1997-98 campaign (2016-17).

All-Star Saturday Night will air live on TNT at 8 pm. Graham leads the Eastern Conference and ranks fourth in the NBA this season in total three-point field goals made (176) and ranks second in the East in three-point field goals made per game (a career-high 3.5). On Dec. 4, Graham tied the Hornets single-game record for three-pointers made with 10 vs. Golden State. Additionally, Graham connected on three-or-more three-point field goals in a career-long streak of 18 games (Dec. 4 \u2013 Jan. 18), which was the second-longest streak of such games in the NBA this season. Graham, who is participating in the 3-Point Contest for the first time, will become the fifth Hornets player to compete in the contest, joining Scott Burrell (1995), Dell Curry (1992 and 1994), Glen Rice (1996, 1997 and 1998) and Kemba Walker (2017 and 2019). Along with Graham, the other participants in this year\u2019s 3-Point Contest include: Davis Bertans (Washington Wizards), Joe Harris (Brooklyn Nets), Buddy Hield (Sacramento Kings), Zach LaVine (Chicago Bulls), Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers), Duncan Robinson (Miami Heat) and Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks). The 3-Point Contest will feature a new look with the addition of two shots in the \u201cMD Zone\u201d \u2013 two locations positioned equidistant between the traditional racks at the top of the 3-point arc and the adjacent \u201cwing\u201d rack. Each of the two ball pedestals in the MD Zone is located 6 feet behind the 3-point line and holds one special green ball, the \u201c3-Ball.\u201d Shots made with the green ball are worth three points. In addition to the two new shots, the 3-Point contest will continue to have five main shooting locations \u2013 four racks containing four official NBA game balls (each worth one point) and one multicolored \u201cmoney\u201d ball (worth two points) as well as one special \u201call money ball\u201d rack. Every ball on the all money ball rack, which each participant can place at any of the five traditional shooting locations, is worth two points. With the addition of the MTN DEW Zone, the number of balls has increased to 27 from 25, the amount of time in around has expanded to 70 seconds (1:10) from 60 seconds (1:00) and the maximum possible score in a round has risen to 40 points from 34 points. The three competitors with the highest scores in the first round advance to the championship round.

Miles Bridges notched his fourth double-double of the season, finishing with 20 points on 8-of-17 shooting and a career-high 15 rebounds (five offensive) in the loss. Bridges has now scored 15 points in a personal best five consecutive games and tallied the first 20/15 outing by a Hornet player since April 3, 2018 (Dwight Howard at Chicago). It was a 103-103 game midway through the fourth quarter before the Rockets uncorked a 10-0 run over two minutes of play to take a double-digit lead. Charlotte managed to stay within striking distance down the stretch, but in the end, there was just too much James Harden to handle, who tallied 14 points and four assists for Houston in the final frame. \u201cI thought we were great tonight. We battled, we competed, we came out tonight with a great mindset on a back-to-back,\u201d said Coach Borrego afterwards. \u201cWe traveled, we\u2019ve been all over the world [lately]. We got off to a great start, we competed for 48 minutes. I\u2019m proud of the group. It was a great effort.\u201d Terry Rozier also had 20 points for the Hornets, who dropped their 15th straight road appearance in Houston. Malik Monk amassed 19 points off the bench and Devonte\u2019 Graham racked up 16 points and a team-high 10 assists for his 14th double-double of the campaign. Cody Martin made his first career NBA start, chipping in 12 points and five rebounds, while Willy Hernang\u00f3mez added another 10 points and eight rebounds. Harden ended the night with game highs in scoring (40 points on 11-of-26 shooting; 14-of-15 from the line) and assists (11) in addition to grabbing nine rebounds. Danuel House Jr. (22 points), Eric Gordon (16 points; 0-of-12 from three), Ben McLemore (14 points), PJ Tucker (13 points) and Austin Rivers (11 points) rounded out Houston\u2019s double-figure scorers. Both Russell Westbrook (left thumb sprain) and Clint Capela (right heel contusion) were out for the Rockets. Charlotte won the rebounding battle, 53-41, and outscored Houston in both paint points (50-46) and second-chance points (22-14). Houston shot 20-of-60 from three-point range, which is now the most attempts by any NBA team from long distance in a single game so far this season (previous: 56 by Brooklyn at Boston on Nov. 27, 2019). Borrego added, \u201cWe\u2019ve emphasized [rebounding] and guys are just taking more pride on that end of the floor. Rebounding the ball, being more physical on the board has been an emphasis for us. We can\u2019t rely on one guy to go get 20 boards a night. We have to do it collectively and we\u2019ve done that. We won the board and the paint last night and we won the board and the paint again tonight. We just have to stick with that formula and hopefully shots will fall for us.\u201d The Hornets are off for the next three days before returning to action on Saturday, Feb. 8 to face the Dallas Mavericks starting at 7 PM EST at Spectrum Center.

Devonte\u2019 Graham, PJ Washington and Miles Bridges will be the 11th, 12th and 13th different Charlotte players chosen for this particular event, which started in 1994 and features the NBA\u2019s top rookie and second-year players. The organization has sent multiple players on just two other occasions: Raymond Felton and Adam Morrison (2007), followed by Kemba Walker and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2013). Since the NBA implemented the Team USA vs. Team World format in 2015, only two other franchises have had at least three American representatives in the same season. The Philadelphia 76ers had Michael Carter-Williams, Nerlens Noel and Robert Covington selected in 2015, while Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma were chosen from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. Graham joins Lee Nailon in 2002 as the only second-round or undrafted Charlotte player to receive this honor. Other non-first-round players to reach the Rising Stars Challenge for the American side in recent years include Malcolm Brogdon (2017-2018), Jonathon Simmons (2017), Jordan Clarkson (2016) and Robert Covington (2015). Graham and former Kansas teammate Svi Mykhailiuk (World/Ukraine) will notably be squaring off in the competition. \u201cI\u2019m just blessed, thankful to be picked to play in this game,\u201d he said in an interview with Hornets.com. \u201cWe got a lot of young guys that are competitive, hard-working, play the right way and play for each other. We\u2019re trying to keep getting better and this is a nice little step in showing how hard we work. I hit up Svi, told him congratulations and Facetimed him.\u201d PJ Washington will be the first Hornet rookie to make the Rising Stars Challenge since Kidd-Gilchrist in 2013 and sixth overall alongside Walker (2012), Morrison (2007), Emeka Okafor (2005) and George Zidek (1996). Two of Washington\u2019s University of Kentucky teammates in rookie Tyler Herro (USA) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (World/Canada) were also both chosen. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun, especially experiencing it with my teammates,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard this year, so to get recognized is definitely going to be big for us. It\u2019s special. Not a lot of people get to enjoy All-Star Weekend and get invited. It\u2019s definitely going to be fun, crazy. I\u2019ll play with Tyler again and definitely going to be trash talking Shai.\u201d Bridges has seen his scoring average increase from 7.5 PPG to 12.2 PPG between his first and second seasons. He got a taste of All-Star Weekend last season with the Slam Dunk Contest in Charlotte and this year, will be joining fellow 2018 lottery selection and Michigan State teammate Jaren Jackson Jr. on the Team USA side. \u201cIt feels good. I feel blessed to be able to be in this game,\u201d said Bridges. \u201cA lot of great players have come through the Rising Stars Challenge. We have a young core and we\u2019ve been playing pretty well the whole year. For us to get rewarded for it, I feel like it\u2019s a great accomplishment for us and the team. It\u2019ll be great playing with my teammates and playing with Jaren again is also going to be fun. I really can\u2019t wait. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens.\u201d The Memphis Grizzlies are the only other team with three players invited to this year\u2019s Rising Stars Challenge, with Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. chosen for Team USA and Brandon Clarke (Canada) suiting up for Team World. As tirelessly committed as the Charlotte Hornets organization has been this season to youth and player development, sending a record three players to All-Star Weekend certainly couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.

Charlotte trailed by three at half before allowing the Magic to win the third quarter, 29-23 after the visitors shot 60% from the field in the frame. Orlando then opened the final 12 minutes on a 14-6 run to take a game-high 16-point lead with 7:45 remaining on the clock. The Hornets responded with a 12-3 stretch to get within seven, but never got any closer the rest of the way.

Second halves have been a troublesome area as of late for the team and although the third and fourth quarters weren\u2019t particularly stellar in this one, there were at least some positives to take away this time. \u201cThey are a really good defending team and we just weren\u2019t making shots when we needed to and they were,\u201d said Cody Martin, who finished with a career-high 13 points and eight rebounds. \u201cThere were a couple times where we pressured and we had them in a good spot and they found the open man and they knocked down shots, so that was the difference in the second half.

Charlotte was outscored 64-27 in the second half, the team\u2019s lowest output over the final two quarters since scoring 23 against the Washington Wizards on March 9, 2015. In total, San Antonio scored 23 points off turnovers during this stretch (had three in the first half and zero in the second quarter). The Hornets will now return home and start a back-to-back on Monday, Feb. 3 when they face the Orlando Magic starting at 7 PM EST at Spectrum Center.

There are no \u2018little things\u2019 on a stage as big as the NBA Finals. And certainly not as big as the 2016 Finals were \u2013 pitting Cleveland\u2019s Big Three on a mission to avenge 50 years of misery against the most accomplished regular season squad in NBA history (and reigning Champs). If you\u2019re engrossed in the weeklong re-airing of that epic seven-game series on FSO this week, you\u2019ve seen how crucial every possession, every 50-50 ball, every inch of floor matter when it comes to the Whole Enchilada. So as we close out the first week of Cava-Lists, here\u2019s a list of \u2018little things\u2019 that added up to the biggest moment in franchise history, allowed the Wine &amp; Gold to do something that\u2019s never been done before and, in the end, killed Cleveland\u2019s curse ... Phil Handy, now an assistant coach with the Lakers after winning another title on the Raptors bench last season, was a key player development coach with the 2015-16 Cavaliers \u2013 working very closely with Kyrie Irving but essentially the entire team. He was a fixture working guys out hard during pregame. He\u2019s also an Oakland native, and after taking heat from his hometown buddies after the Game 1 shellacking, had all he could take following the Warriors\u2019 33-point lambasting in Game 2. And he let the team know about it in a profanity-laced diatribe in the Oracle Arena after. \u201d(It was) something we all knew, that we had to play harder,\u201d Ty Lue said the following day. \u201cJust had to continue to compete for 48 minutes, not one quarter, not a quarter-and-a-half. What he said was right on. The guys accepted that, they understood it and we just moved on.\" Cleveland went 4-1 the rest of the way. Yeah, he rattled off a list of different movies, but there\u2019s one that just seemed perfect for the Cleveland vs. The World situation. At the podium after winning Game 7, LeBron was asked about the calm that he seemed to have going into the pressure-packed situation. \u201dI can sit up here and say -- I don't know if it was \u2018The Godfather,\u2019 I don't know if it was \u2018Couples Retreat\u2019 that I watched, I don't know if it was \u2018Ocean's 11, 12, and 13,\u2019 I don't know if it was the \u2018Revenge of the Nerds\u2019 that I watched. I really don't know.\u201d There\u2019s just something satisfying about picturing Numeral 23 being inspired by Gilbert, Lewis and Tri-Lamda taking down the Alpha Betas. Both Iman Shumpert and J.R. Smith arrived in early January 2015 and both had plenty of postseason moments in the spotlight. J.R. set the Wine &amp; Gold\u2019s playoff three-point shooting mark in his first Playoff run with Cleveland and broke it the following year. Fans sometimes forget how vital Shump was in the Cavs\u2019 previous postseason run \u2013 staring the last 16 games of the Playoffs, including all six against Golden State. Both had huge huge moments in Game 7. With just over seven minutes to play before half, Shumpert drilled a three-pointer and was fouled by Shaun Livingston, giving the Cavs a two-point lead and keeping them connected. J.R. did his damage right on the other end of intermission. Golden State led by seven at half, but Smith hit a jumper to start the scoring for Cleveland. The Warriors would eventually build a quick eight-point lead, 54-46, and looked like they were ready to start pulling away. But 'Swish' drilled two straight triples, picked Klay Thompson\u2019s pocket on the very next possession and fed ahead to Kyrie Irving, who scored on a layup to tie the game at 54. The rest, as they say, is history. It was a trick Ty Lue learned from Doc Rivers in Boston, but after Game 5\u2019s win in Oakland, the Cavs coach asked for players and personnel to pitch in $100 apiece and placed the cash in a ceiling panel above the coach\u2019s office \u2013 to be picked up after the squad returned (and won) Game 7 at Oracle Arena. The Wine &amp; Gold took care of business in Game 6 and came back for the cash three days later. Two reserve guards who didn\u2019t see much action during the series both had big/small moments in the Cavs big Game 6 win. Dahntay Jones, a 12-year veteran who was signed on the final day of the regular season, scored five quick points just before intermission, grabbed a big defensive board and caused Draymond Green to commit his third personal foul. Mo Williams, who was an All-Star with the Wine &amp; Gold in 2009, drilled both shots he attempted that night, including a sweet baseline teardrop late in the first half to put Cleveland up 19. The Cavaliers had to win at least one game in Oakland to win the NBA title. Instead they won two games over a six-day span in a gym that hosted just two regular season losses all year in 2016. With the 2015 and 2016 Playoff runs combined, the Cavaliers were 14-7. The year they won the title, Cleveland clinched each series on the road and the Finals marked 25 consecutive postseason series in which LeBron James won at least one game.  That year\u2019s Game 7 was the 19th in NBA history. The last time a team claimed the Championship on the road was 1978 \u2013 with the Bullets winning in Seattle. That victory was also the 100th playoff win in Cavaliers franchise history. So to wrap up the first week of Cava-Lists, here\u2019s a list within a list of things that happened in the 2015-16 season before the Wine &amp; Gold reached the top of the NBA\u2019s mountain in mid-June. That year, the Cavaliers \u2026.  \u2026 played the first 24 games of the season without Kyrie Irving, who was still recovering from knee surgery following an injury in the previous season\u2019s Finals. \u2026 traded Joe Harris \u2013 the NBA\u2019s eventual three-point champ \u2013 to Orlando for a second-rounder in this June\u2019s upcoming Draft \u2026 began the season with Sasha Kaun \u2013 the last draft pick in Seattle SuperSonics history \u2013 as the backup center \u2026 went to Training Camp with Quinn Cook as one of the invitees \u2026 fired David Blatt after 41 games with a 30-11 record \u2026 traded 11-year veteran Anderson Varejao for Channing Frye in a three-team deal at the Deadline. It was a season that began with LeBron James co-starring alongside Amy Schumer in \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d In between, Iman Shumpert helped deliver his daughter in the bathroom of his home using a headphone cord to tie off the umbilical cord and Timofey Mozgov starred in a video riding across the Hope Memorial Bridge on the back of a bear. When it was over, J.R. Smith took his shirt off after the Game 7 victory and didn\u2019t put it back on until the Cavs visited the White House on November 10. And it was good.

Photo by Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images I come from an \u2026 athletic family. My mom, she played basketball and ran track in high school \u2013 and she was really good at both. Actually, my mom was \u2026 a state-competing high-jumper. She went to the same high school as me and to this day she still holds the high-jump record. It\u2019s right there in the wall of the gym of my high school. I have a sister \u2026 who\u2019s three years older than me who also did high-jump, along with soccer and basketball. She goes to Ball State, but doesn\u2019t play organized sports there. Growing up \u2026 I really played everything. Obviously, everybody plays \u2026 organized soccer. I played a lot of soccer \u2013 I played indoor, outdoor soccer. And then I also played \u2026 football in elementary school and middle school. I played on a traveling team for baseball and played baseball through middle school. Obviously, golf and basketball. I played tennis, but not organized \u2013 just against my dad a lot. I\u2019m only a lefty \u2026 in basketball. I guess I kick with my left foot, but everything else is right-handed. I throw a baseball and football \u2026 right-handed, swing a golf club right-handed. I\u2019m a little weird in that way. I probably started golf and basketball \u2026 at around the same time, maybe around five years old. I remember \u2026  going to the driving range with my dad as a little kid and hitting balls before I really knew how to swing a golf club. I couldn\u2019t hit it more than 10 or 20 yards, but I still had fun doing it. And then in hoops \u2026 I played in all the same YMCA basketball leagues probably from around the same age. As young as you were allowed \u2026 to play an organized sport, I played it. I probably started thinking I could \u2026 get to the next level at golf in middle school. I started to see that I was getting better than most everyone else. I was the No. 1 on our middle school team and was the No. 1 as a freshman in high school. So, I always thought I could take golf to the next level. \"I think it\u2019d be really fun to complete against some other NBA guys, if there would ever be a pro-am tournament or something like that.\" Dylan Windler, on the chance to golf against fellow NBA players Basketball, I was always \u2026 pretty good, but I didn\u2019t have the height until about sophomore, junior year of high school. That\u2019s when I started to get better. And then I got a break in a Tournament playing AAU during my junior year. So it was until my junior year \u2026 where I thought I might have a chance to take basketball to the next level. I\u2019m not exactly how many \u2026 NBA guys are also pretty serious golfers. I think I\u2019d do pretty well \u2026 against most guys. I know Steph (Curry) plays and he\u2019s really good. J.R. (Smith) plays. I know he\u2019s not in the league right now, but I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s good. But I think Steph is really up there among NBA guys. I think it\u2019d be \u2026 really fun to complete against some other NBA guys, if there would ever be a pro-am tournament or something like that. Everyone thinks golf \u2026 is something you can do every day. But golf was actually almost more of a grind than basketball in high school. You\u2019re going to practice \u2026 every day after school for about two hours, and then during the summers you have a tournament every weekend. Throughout the week you\u2019re at the golf course every day for a couple hours \u2013 whether you\u2019re chipping and putting or at the driving range. Every now and then you get \u2026 out on the course, but for the most part, I\u2019d go but never actually play the course \u2013 just hit the driving range or chipping or putting range for hours. It\u2019s very frustrating \u2026 at times because golf is just a very up-and-down sport and it\u2019s hard to be consistent. When you have one of those tournaments when you\u2019re just not playing well, it can be mentally exhausting. In 8th grade, I was \u2026 a point guard because I wasn\u2019t that tall. And then, during my freshman and sophomore \u2026 years in high school, I went from six foot to 6-5. I switched out onto the wing, but I still had all those ball-handling skills, because in middle school and even before that I was always the one bringing the ball up. That growth spurt \u2026 really gave me a big advantage. That\u2019s right around the time \u2026 that I finally got my first dunk. I think it was the summer \u2026 going into my freshman year in high school. I remember I couldn\u2019t dunk in middle school and I was really mad about it because I had a couple teammates that could, and it really got to me. So I remember \u2026 that whole summer I worked on it and was constantly trying to dunk. And then right before the start \u2026 of my freshman season, it was open gym and of course everyone is trying to dunk and show off. And I finally got one! The guys all \u2026 went nuts. But you know when you get that first one. It\u2019s always kind of a scene.

On Sunday April 20, The Championship Parade and Rally will be aired as well. Cavs.com takes you back to the Summer of '16 with highlights, sounds, and stats to get you primed to relive one of the greatest championship runs of all time. GAME 1 Tyronn Lue\u2019s squad put themselves in an excellent position to make a fourth-quarter run \u2013 rallying from an 11-point deficit to take a one-point edge with just over two minutes to play in the third period. But an aggressive foul by Matthew Dellavedova against last year\u2019s Finals MVP, Andre Iguodala, seemed to ignite the Warriors \u2013 and their rapid crowd. Golden State then proceeded to score the final seven points of the third quarter and the first eight of the fourth, eventually extending their lead to 20 points before holding off the Cavaliers down the stretch. In Game 1, LeBron James became the league's all-time leader in three-pointers made in The Finals with 57. James passed Robert Horry (56) and Ray Allen (55) to reach the first spot. GAME 2 Two games into the 2016 Finals, the Cavaliers are still searching for the squad that ran roughshod through the Eastern Conference bracket, going 12-2 en route to their rematch with the Warriors. They leave Oakland having being beaten by an average of 20 points, having shot 37 percent from the floor and 27 percent from long-distance \u2013 handing out a combined 32 assists while committing a combined 35 turnovers. Following Game 2, the Wine &amp; Gold returned to Quicken Loans Arena hoping that some home cooking can get them back into the series. GAME 3 After dropping the first two games of the NBA Finals convincingly, the Cavaliers resoundingly turned the tables \u2013 dominating the Warriors from wire-to-wire, 120-90, to cut Golden State\u2019s series lead to 2-1 with Game 4 set for Friday night in Cleveland. The Cavaliers team that dropped the previous two games by a combined 48 points was nowhere in sight on Wednesday \u2013 running out to a 19-4 lead and bumping their edge to 20 points before the end of one quarter. After the game, Richard Jefferson said \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about our crowd. Our crowd was amazing tonight. They were ready. They were geared up and ready. They didn\u2019t care about what happened in Golden State. They knew we\u2019re a great team at home. A lot of that is in part to the energy that they bring us.\u201d GAME 4 Including the 2016 Playoffs, the Cavaliers put together 10 streaks of at least three straight wins this season. They needed one more if they hope to make history and wrestle the NBA title away from the World Champs \u2013 who outscored the Wine &amp; Gold, 58-42, in the second stanza and held on for the 108-97 victory in Game 4 at The Q. The Cavs headed to The Bay for Game 5 as history started to take shape. GAME 5 Heading into Game 5, the Cavaliers knew that they\u2019d have to make history to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals. And on Monday, two of their stars got a head start on rewriting some history along the way. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving became the first teammate duo in league history to score more than 40 points in a Finals game \u2013 putting on a jaw-dropping display on both ends in a game the Wine &amp; Gold needed for their very survival. GAME 6 In Game 6, the Cavaliers did something that hasn\u2019t been done in 50 years \u2013 sending the NBA Finals to Game 7 after trailing the series, 3-1. But the Wine &amp; Gold aren\u2019t interested snapping a mark that\u2019s lasted 50 years. The one they\u2019re chasing has extended for 52. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since any Cleveland team has won a major sports championship \u2013 something the Cavaliers can change when both squads square off for the 2016 NBA title on Sunday night in Oakland. Throughout the 2016 Playoffs, the Cavaliers hosted 10 games at Quicken Loans Arena. In those 10 games, Cleveland went 9-1 at home. In those nine victories, the Cavaliers have outscored their opponents by 17.9 points per, shooting 50 percent from the floor and 43 percent from three-point range. GAME 7 History made. The Cleveland Cavaliers overcame all odds and climbed out of a 3-1 hole to win the 2016 NBA Finals in thrilling fashion and to capture the franchise's first title. The Block. The Shot. The Stop. These plays will live in Cavaliers history forever and no one will soon forget the events that unfolded in June of 2016. CHAMPIONSHIP PARADE After the Cavs returned to Northeast Ohio, one of the biggest- perhaps the biggest- party in Cleveland took place. On a hot and sunny June 22, more than one million Cavalier fans packed the streets of downtown Cleveland to celebrate the NBA title with the players and coaches as the Larry O'Brien Trophy circled Quicken Loans Arena.

And after a road-bump in Game 4, it just gets better from there. On Monday, we tipped off our new feature \u2013 the cheesily-named \u201cCava-List\u201d \u2013 and broke down some of the nuts and bolts of how that squad was built from a team that dropped 26 straight games in 2010 to an NBA Champion six seasons later. The 2015-16 team had some colorful, quotable dudes. Some loved the media spotlight; others not so much. But when World Champs talk, people listen. Here\u2019s a list of some of the more interesting quotes uttered during the Cavaliers epic run at that title \u2026  LeBron James, following Game 7 \u2026 \u201dJust knowing what our city has been through, northeast Ohio has been through, as far as our sports and everything for the last 50-plus years.  You could look back to the Earnest Byner fumble, Elway going 99 yards, to Jose Mesa not being able to close out in the bottom of the ninth to the Cavs went to The Finals \u2013 I was on that team \u2013 in 2007, us getting swept, and then last year us losing, 4-2. And our fans, they ride or die, no matter what's been going on, no matter the Browns, the Indians, the Cavs and so on, and all other sports teams. They continue to support us. And for us to be able to end this, end this drought, our fans deserve it. They deserve it. And it was for them.\u201d Richard Jefferson, on Cleveland fans heading into Game 7 \u2026 \u201dMy first seven years, I was with one team and we kind of got things started out there. We really established ourselves as a group. And then going on to different teams \u2013 I've been in Dallas, San Antonio, played here in Golden State, been in Utah. I've been able to experience so many different fan bases, so many different struggles and successes. To be in Cleveland, to be around them and see, even when we were down 3-1, it was eerie how optimistic they were. It really was. It was the messages and: \u2018We believe in you guys, keep going; regardless of what's happened, we're just so proud of you.\u2019 You're just like, \u2018Where are those pissed-off fans from New Jersey that I grew up watching, those pissed-off New Yorker fans?\u2019 It's just a different mentality.\u201d Tyronn Lue\u2019s message to the team heading to Oakland, down 3-1 \u2026 \u201dIf you don't think we can win, don't get on the plane.\u201d Kyrie Irving, on his mindset going into the second half of Game 7 \u2026 \u201dAll I was thinking in the back of my mind was Mamba mentality, just Mamba mentality. That's all I was thinking.\u201d James Jones, on the team believing in Tyronn Lue and his staff heading into the Finals \u2026 \u201dThis group is receptive because we understand that we\u2019re playing for something that\u2019s so much bigger than ourselves, so much bigger than basketball. To be able to reach the heights we\u2019ve reached, we\u2019ve had to sacrifice a lot and a lot of people have given and poured a lot into us. Coach Lue reminds us, and we all understand that this is life-changing \u2013 not only for us, but for others. It\u2019s an opportunity we can\u2019t miss.\u201d Kevin Love, in a bit of foreshadowing heading into the 2016 Finals \u2026 \u201dI don't know if I'll ever be the guy that's going to be a lockdown defender, but I think as far as team concepts go and being a team defender, I've gotten a lot better. I think I've showed that throughout these Playoffs.\u201d J.R. Smith, on what the Cavs would change when Draymond Green rejoined the Warriors for Game 6 \u2026 \u201dNothing. We can\u2019t change anything. We have to continue to play with desperation to exhaustion. We have to go home for Game 6 and try to force a Game 7. Mentally, nothing can change. We have to bring the same effort.\u201d Tristan Thompson, after tempers flared in Game 4, resulting in the one-game suspension of Draymond Green \u2026 \u201dLet's put it like this: If you're going to trash talk, you better back up whatever you say. If you open your mouth, you better be prepared.\u201d Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson, poking the bear in the media session the day before Game 5 in Oakland \u2026 \u201dI don't know how the man feels. But obviously people have feelings and people's feelings get hurt even if they're called a bad word. I guess his feelings just got hurt.\u201d Said bear, LeBron James, in the exchange with a reporter informing him he\u2019d been poked \u2026 Q: When the Warriors were up here, there was some talk about what trash talk crosses the line and what doesn't. Klay Thompson said: I guess he just got his feelings hurt. You talked about being a prideful guy and some comments Draymond made. Would you discuss that whole issue of what's fair and not fair on the court? LeBron James: What happened? What Klay said? Q: Yeah, and what crosses the line \u2026 James: No, I'm not \u2026 wait, what did you say Klay said? Q: Klay said: \u2018I guess he just got his feelings hurt.\u2019 James: *(laughing)* Oh, my goodness. Tristan Thompson, after Saturday\u2019s practice in preparation for Game 7 \u2026 \u201dI\u2019m definitely more experienced, but I\u2019d never been in a situation where we\u2019ve been down, 3-1, so this is definitely new. By the same token, you just have to give it everything you\u2019ve got right now \u2013 because this is what you live for.\u201d Kyrie Irving, on what went through his head on his game-winning triple for the title \u2026 \u201dI'm just hoping it goes in.\u201d LeBron James, on having to play the series-clincher at Oracle Arena \u2026 \u201dIt don't matter to me. Like I told you guys the other day, it's two of the greatest words in the world \u2013 and that's \"Game Seven.\" So I'll play it anywhere.\u201d Richard Jefferson, on LeBron \u2026 \u201dNot many people in the history of sports have said, \u2018Everyone get on my back. The city, state, organization, team, get on my back. If we fail, I\u2019ll take the blame, but I\u2019m going to lead you.\u2019 How many people have ever said that? I can\u2019t think of too many players who have put that type of pressure on themselves and then have delivered more times than not.\u201d Tyronn Lue, on his emotions after making history in Game 7 \u2026 \u201dAfter the game, it was just \u2013 I never cry. I've always been tough and never cried. Just after the game \u2013 my brother is here, Greg, just said: \u2018I've never seen you cry before.\u2019 Just a lot of emotions just built up. My grandfather couldn't be here. He passed away, and all the haters and all the doubters. It just all built up at one time. Then finally hearing that last horn go off, it was just unbelievable. It didn't feel right. It didn't feel right. My mom, she's a minister, and God is good.\u201d J.R. Smith, in his emotional speech at the podium after the Game 7 victory on Father\u2019s Day \u2026 \u201dToday is so special to me. It's on Father's Day. My dad put the ball in my crib. I mean, my parents, my family, that's the biggest inspiration in my life. I've been in a lot of dark spots in my life, and if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be able to get out of it. But they are who they are. They fought with me. They yelled at me, they screamed at me, they loved me, they hugged me, they cried with me, and they always stuck by my side no matter right or wrong. I know a lot of people don't have their parents in their life \u2013 their mother, their father. But I've got the best two you could ask for, I swear. There's six of us, and they didn't treat any of us different.  They loved us the same. They treated us all the same, and I just wanted to be like them when I grow up. I mean, my dad is easily one of my biggest inspirations to play this game. To hear people talk bad about me, it hurts me because I know it hurts him, and that's not who I am. And I know he raised me better, and I know I want to do better. Just everything I do is for my parents and my family. I mean, the cars are nice, the houses are nice, but none of this matters without them.  If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here. I don't know where I would be, honestly. If it wasn't for them, if it wasn't for the structure and the backbone that I have, I wouldn't be able to mess up and keep coming back and being able to sit in front of you as a World Champion.\u201d Accessibility \tDirections \tHave a Great Idea? \tJob Opportunities \tRocket Mortgage FieldHouse Sign In \t| \tSign Up Your Profile \t| \tSign Out "}

Charlotte began its voyage with a disappointing 121-107 loss in Washington on Thursday night, a game in which the Wizards won the second half by a 66-47 margin. Miles Bridges (23) and Terry Rozier (21) both had 20-point games for the Hornets, who are currently mired in their roughest stretch of the season having lost nine of 10 appearances When asked after the loss about the team\u2019s goals for the second half of the season, Borrego responded, \u201cJust to be competitive. Play hard. Develop our young guys. Make sure we play the right way. I thought we played stretches tonight, but the goal is to really play for 48 minutes the right way. Right now, we\u2019re doing it for maybe half a game, maybe three quarters of a game, but not for 48 minutes.\u201d San Antonio lost both meetings with the Hornets last season and recently snapping a three-game losing streak by knocking off the Utah Jazz, 127-120, at home on Wednesday night without LaMarcus Aldridge. DeMar DeRozan is averaging 37.5 PPG on 55.0% shooting over his last two outings for a Spurs squad that ranks 10th in the league in offensive rating (111.3), 22nd in defensive rating (111.9) and fourth in bench scoring (45.0 PPG on 44.8% shooting). Like New York (who the Hornets beat on Tuesday), San Antonio is a mid-range dominant team, sitting first in the NBA in field-goal attempts from this area (22.7), third in percentage (45.2%), 27th in three-point field goals (10.4) and 29th in three-point attempts (28.3). The Spurs\u2019 offense is a unique one to guard in today\u2019s NBA and the Hornets will need a much-improved defensive showing if they want to bring back a victory to Charlotte. Game Notes: LaMarcus Aldridge (right thumb sprain) has missed San Antonio\u2019s last two games\u2026 Borrego was a member of the Spurs organization from 2003-10 and then again from 2015-18\u2026 The Hornets have one three-game winning streak against San Antonio in franchise history (Jan. 18, 1991 \u2013 March 25, 1992).

If you tuned in for Game 1 on Sunday night and are back for Game 2 on Monday, here\u2019s a spoiler alert: as the week moves on, things get way, WAY better! While we re-gird for the seven-game epic, Cavs.com tips off a new feature \u2013 calling it the \u201cCava-List\u201d \u2013 that\u2019ll break down some facet of the Wine &amp; Gold into bite-sized pieces. (Yeah, we know it\u2019s a tacky title.)  And what better place to start than those exhilarating, exhausting 17 days in June of 2016? Today\u2019s catalog looks at how that Finals squad was built. Tristan Thompson was as close to a full-blooded Cavalier as that team had. He was the Wine &amp; Gold\u2019s actual 2011 Draft pick \u2013 No. 4 overall out of Texas, and the blue-collar big has manned the middle ever since. Cleveland got contributions from all over the roster over the course of the 2015-16 regular season \u2013 from Mo Williams\u2019 19 points in the season opener in Chicago to Jordan McRae\u2019s 36-point detonation in the regular season finale. But once the NBA\u2019s tournament rolled around, Coach Ty Lue tightened things up considerably. Again, there were big moments from role players in the postseason \u2013 from Dahntay Jones\u2019 clutch moments before half in Game 6 to Iman Shumpert\u2019s four-point play in Game 7. But it was essentially a seven-man rotation (with a dash of Delly and Shump) for much of the Playoffs and especially in the 2016 Finals. Even Timofey Mozgov, who started 48 games that season, saw scant action (5.8mpg) in the postseason. Here\u2019s a Cava-List \u2013 in no particular order \u2013 of the moves that eventually erased a city\u2019s half-century of sports misery ... By now, most Cavs fans know that Kyrie Irving was actually the Draft pick Cleveland received from the Clippers late in the previous season. He was both a key piece of Cleveland\u2019s title-winning run and a cautionary tale for GMs who don\u2019t put the word \u201cprotected\u201d on traded picks. At the 2011 Deadline, Cleveland sent All-Star Mo Williams and Jamario Moon to the Clippers in exchange for Baron Davis and the Clippers\u2019 unprotected pick in that June\u2019s Draft. Los Angeles finished the season with a 32-50 record, Davis averaged 13.9ppg in 15 games for Cleveland and, about a month later, the Cavaliers (and 14-year-old Nick Gilbert) made history, defying a 2.8 percent chance to win the Lottery. Cleveland did, and that year\u2019s No. 1 pick \u2013 a quiet, quirky point guard from Duke named Kyrie Irving would go on to win that season\u2019s Rookie of the Year, the 2014 All-Star MVP award and, of course, hit the biggest single shot in franchise history. Long before the Cavaliers\u2019 unprecedented Lottery run that began in 2011, the franchise underwent seismic change eight years earlier when it won the 2003 sweepstakes, with ping-pong balls totaling \u201c23\u201d and the chance to select a transcendent talent from 40 miles down the road in Akron. LeBron James led the new expression of Wine &amp; Gold to five playoff runs, the team\u2019s first trip to the NBA Finals in 2007 and a complete re-writing of the record books during his first seven-year stretch. He then took his talents to South Beach in 2010, demolished the Cavs in his first game back and won two titles with Miami. But by time the Cavs retired Zydrunas Ilgauskas\u2019 number in early March 2014, the city (and apparently, the King) were feeling all warm and fuzzy again. And that July, Numeral 23 announced his return to Cleveland as a free agent. In his first year back, James was Herculean in six Finals games. He was superhuman the following June. As long as we\u2019re talking Lottery, the Cavaliers once again defied the odds in the offseason before LeBron came back \u2013 overcoming 1.7 percent odds to win their second straight Lottery \u2013 and the rights to the 2014 Draft\u2019s overall first pick, Kansas swingman Andrew Wiggins. (One year after selecting UNLV forward Anthony Bennett with the top choice.) Bennett averaged 4.2ppg and didn\u2019t start a single game for the Cavs as a rookie and Wiggins barely finished his first Summer League stint with Cleveland \u2013 under new head coach David Blatt \u2013 before being dealt to Minnesota in exchange for All-Star Kevin Love, who\u2019d averaged 26.1 points and 12.5 boards the previous season with the T-Wolves. Love\u2019s numbers took a slight dip in Cleveland and he got cheated out of his first Finals run after suffering a season-ending injury against Boston in the First Round in 2015, but was a huge contributor the following season, netting 10 double-doubles in the Playoffs and had maybe the biggest single defensive stop in team history late in Game 7 against league MVP Steph Curry. The Cavs title-winning run of 2016 was almost pure perfection \u2013 and Channing Frye is the reason it was both \u201cpure perfection\u201d and \u201calmost.\u201d Frye arrived in a Deadline deal in February 2016 and proceeded to lead the NBA in three-point shooting that postseason, going a staggering 41-for-69 from long-range \u2013 completing tormenting the Hawks the Second Round and drilling 63 percent of his triples in the Conference Finals against Toronto. The \u201calmost\u201d part is that the Cavaliers weren\u2019t able to celebrate the title with the \u201cWild Thing\u201d \u2013 Anderson Varejao, who, after 11-plus seasons in Cleveland, was part of the deal to acquire Frye: a three-team trade with the Magic and Blazers. The Cavaliers sent Jared Cunningham to Orlando, Varejao and a 2018 first rounder (who eventually turned out to be Moritz Wagner) to Portland, with the Blazers sending a 2020 second round pick to the Magic. In a bit of cruel irony, the beloved Varejao signed with the Warriors after his release from Portland and was part of the team Cleveland vanquished to win the title that June. Richard Jefferson\u2019s route to Cleveland wasn\u2019t complicated. He was an under-the-radar signing in early August 2015. But he\u2019d been all over the league before setting in as an indispensable member of the Cavaliers Championship-winning squad. Jefferson had already played for six different teams before his arrival in Cleveland, including with Tyronn Lue as a player in Milwaukee (and that was his third stop). But Jefferson, who had Finals experience with the Nets, brought not just on-court production but some levity to a locker room that was understandably pressure-packed. All Jefferson did in the 2016 Playoffs was make 21 appearances, provide steady leadership, start two big games in the Finals and go .516 from three-point range (16-of-31) against the Warriors \u2013 another one of his former teams. The Cavaliers first major move in the chess game that\u2019s building a Championship squad came midway through the previous season. Just before the Wine &amp; Gold was set to square off against the Sixers on January 5, 2015, they pulled a major three-team deal \u2013 sending Dion Waiters to Oklahoma City; Lou Amundson, Alex Kirk and a 2019 2nd round pick to the Knicks all in exchange for New York teammates Iman Shumpert and J.R. Smith. (Future draft picks involved in that complicated deal eventually turned out to be Furkan Korkmaz and Carsen Edwards.) Shumpert came up big in the 2015 Finals, helping an injury-depleted Cavaliers squad nearly overcome Golden State in six bare-knuckle battles. But it was J.R. that put Cleveland over the top the following June \u2013 drilling 65 three-pointers (besting his franchise Playoff record 51 from the previous season) in the Cavs\u2019 legendary postseason run. Swish scored 762 total points during his Playoff career in Cleveland, but none were bigger than the eight straight he piled up after halftime of Game 7 in 2016. Without them, it\u2019s likely that the Block, the Shot and Stop might never have happened.

Miles Bridges finished with a team-high 23 points on 8-of-17 shooting, six rebounds (five offensive), three assists and two steals in the loss, which was Charlotte\u2019s ninth in 10 outings. In three meetings with Washington this season, Bridges is averaging 23.3 PPG on 50.0% shooting from the field and 45.0% from three (9-of-20). Charlotte led by five at half before the Wizards won the third quarter, 31-19, and entered the fourth with an 86-79 advantage. Washington shot 60.0% from the field in the frame and got 11 points from Isaiah Thomas as the Hornets connected on just 6-of-23 shot attempts (26.1%). The hosts then opened the final 12 minutes on a 9-3 run and never looked back in route to a fifth win in six home outings. On the night, Washington dominated the rebounding battle, 57-38. \u201cIt was the board and the defense. They had 66 points in the second half,\u201d said Coach Borrego. \u201cSolid first half, but not great. We talked about the board at halftime and before the game. A lack of physicality, presence and pride about getting a rebound out there. We didn\u2019t deserve to win tonight. It was a very disappointing second half.\u201d He added, \u201cYou can\u2019t teach pride and physicality. They have to figure that out. If they want to win a game, if we want to win a game, they have to go get rebounds. Sometimes, that\u2019s boxing out. Sometimes, that digging one out. Sometimes, that\u2019s presence out there figuring out a way to get a rebound. That\u2019s the bottom line. This isn\u2019t tricky. We could do 20 minutes of rebounding drills, but in the end, they have to have pride about rebounding the ball.\u201d Terry Rozier notched 21 points, seven rebounds and three assists, while PJ Washington (15 points), Willy Hernang\u00f3mez (12) and Devonte\u2019 Graham (11) rounded out the Hornets\u2019 double-figure scorers. Graham also added a team-high eight assists and Cody Zeller chipped in nine points, seven rebounds and career-high-tying seven dimes. On the other side, Bradley Beal had game highs across the board in scoring (34 points; 14-of-15 from the free-throw line), rebounding (9) and assists (9) in the victory. Thomas Bryant (21 points on 9-of-11 shooting), Isaiah Thomas (18), Troy Brown Jr. (12) and Ish Smith (11 points, nine coming in fourth) also had double-digit scoring performances for the Wizards. Washington won the bench scoring battle, 52-28 and connected on 25-of-27 shots from the line (92.6%). Charlotte had just nine total turnovers leading to 11 Washington points, although shot just 9-of-30 from distance (30.0%).

Despite shooting just 38.6% from the field, the Hornets hustled and muscled their way to a much-needed 97-92 home win over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. It\u2019s been a tough few days for everybody in the NBA following the sudden death of legend Kobe Bryant and the skid-snapping win couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s been a while since we won, so this one feels good,\u201d said Cody Zeller. \u201cI\u2019ve felt pretty energized after only playing two games in the last 12 days or so [because of the Paris game]. It has been emotional for all of us. A lot of us played against Kobe or grew up watching him and he was such a big icon. He just seemed so invincible to me and the fact that nobody is invincible kind of hit home that life is fragile.\u201d The home team is 2-0 in this season series so far, with the Hornets winning the most recent meeting, 114-107, back on Dec. 10. Devonte\u2019 Graham led six Charlotte players in double figures with 29 points and six assists, while Washington got a career-high 32 points (8-of-12 from three) from reserve D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns, but just 16 points on 6-of-19 shooting from Bradley Beal. Washington is 15-31, although has won 5 of its last 12 outings despite injuries stacking up. Beal is averaging an astounding 40.3 PPG on 56.6% shooting and 6.3 APG over his last four games and is backed by the NBA\u2019s second-highest scoring bench unit this season (51.0 PPG). The two-time All-Star\u2019s recent surge is somewhat counterbalanced by a struggling Wizards defense that has a 128.6 defensive rating during this stretch. The Wizards also sit third in the NBA in pace (103.50), fifth in opposing turnovers (15.0) and fifth in points off turnovers (18.1 PPG). Washington can put points up in a hurry and the Hornets will need tight ball security and be locked in defensively if they want to pick up a fifth win in six meetings with their Southeast Division rivals. Game Notes: Moritz Wagner (left ankle sprain) and Garrison Mathews (right ankle sprain) are not expected to play for Washington. Rui Hachimura (groin injury) and Jordan McRae (right ankle sprain) were game-time decisions on Tuesday, but did not play\u2026 Over their last two games, the Wizards became the first NBA team since the Denver Nuggets in December of 1990 to allow 150+ points in consecutive non-overtime games.

No individual or business has been unscathed during this pandemic. We\u2019ve all been impacted deeply - professionally and personally. However, the collective spirit and resiliency of our colleagues has been overwhelming and awe-inspiring.  Employees are working hard every day. Employees are offering support and encouragement to their colleagues \u2013 some of whom have even lost loved ones. Employees are volunteering to assist not only those in dire need but also the courageous and selfless frontline workers. No words will ever do justice to the pride and gratitude our family has for your service to the company as you also continue to do all you can to help \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d  KSE, Kroenke Sports Charities, and the Kroenke Family Foundation have responded in many ways to assist in crisis-relief efforts, including working with several of our business partners and numerous government and non-profit agencies to help tens of thousands of people affected by COVID-19. While supporting these efforts is an obligation and a privilege, our No. 1 priority remains the well-being of our employees \u2013 part-time and full-time. We announced last month that KSE would pay its variable and hourly employees through the end of the regular season once professional leagues announced the suspension of their seasons. Since then we have worked closely with many of these employees to help them better understand the CARES Act and benefits for which they are eligible.  In an effort to further assist these employees, and after speaking with several members of our amazing network of KSE teams, we are pleased to announce that we have established a KSE COVID-19 Relief Fund. We are also proud to announce that the Kroenke Family Foundation will be leading with the first donation into the Fund in the amount of $500,000. Based on comments from our incredible players, coaches, and executive staff, we fully expect the Fund to grow to $1,000,000 in the very near future.  It is our deepest hope that this fund will help provide basic necessities and essentials to those struggling the most financially. We have formed a committee to review and respond to all requests. The only requirement is for those in need to complete a short application to determine eligibility criteria. Any financial assistance an employee receives will not be taxed. Eligible employees will be provided an application in a separate correspondence.  As for our full-time employees, we thank you for continuing to adapt and meet the challenge during this unsettling period. Please continue to work remotely and abide by local stay-at-home mandates. While tough decisions lie ahead for all businesses worldwide, we will continue to do everything in our power to support the well-being of our entire staff.  For employees wishing to contribute to the KSE COVID-19 Relief Fund, you can make a tax-deductible donation to Kroenke Sports Charities. Please contact Deb Dowling for further information (Deb.Dowling@TeamKSE.com).  We would like to give a special thanks to KSE executives and members of our sports organizations from players to coaches to front office executives who have asked how they can contribute. In these uncertain times, giving back and supporting the well-being of our families, communities, and ourselves is more important than ever. We could not be prouder of how our company and employees have come together to provide relief and support to the many in need.  Stay well,  Stan and Josh "}

Photo by Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images Was it a good thing or a bad thing to come into the league on a team so loaded with veterans? Cedi Osman: I think it was a good thing, because my first year we had a relly great team. I think they'd played in three straight NBA Finals. So I was really excited, you know? A chance to win an NBA Championship in my first year! But at one point, I realized that for me to play, I had to really earn my spot because we already had a lot of a lot of great players, a lot of star players. So I think that year really helped me a lot. It helped my game, but I also developed some really great friendships here, too. For some overseas guys coming over, the language barrier is the biggest hurdle. What were some of the big adjustments you had to make? Cedi: The language was not a big problem because my English was getting better every year. So, I really felt comfortable and I had trust in myself, you know, talking to people. Even though I know I was making mistakes, I still kept talking. So that's how I learned English. But I think the biggest adjustment for me was the food, because it's a different type of food here. But thanks to my teammates, the coaches and really the entire organization, they really helped me adjust quickly. So, I really didn't have a lot of problems with adjustments. What was different about the food here? Cedi: Kind of more fried stuff. That's the one thing I had to adjust to. It's not like it's gross or anything. I like fried stuff, too. Just not every day. Because you\u2019d been playing professionally so young, did you feel ready for the league when you made the jump? Cedi: Yeah, I was ready for the NBA. Because I went through a lot of things back overseas. And you know, playing professionally from a young age and then playing against the older guys \u2013 guys over 30; older, talented guys \u2013 was really tough, but it also helped my game grow and just get me ready for the NBA. That first year, before you even started practicing, is it correct that you had some uniform number issues with Dwyane Wade? Cedi: Well, my number was always 6, actually. And obviously, I couldn't take 6. So I chose 9. I preferred taking 9 because of the 6 \u2013 just upside down. \"No matter what, if I got in for one minute or five minutes \u2013 especially that first year, minutes were really crucial for me \u2013 I played hard. And I think they just took me under their wing because I was really playing hard and I really showed them that I want to be a part of the team.\" Cedi Osman, on getting the veterans to accept him as a rookie So, it started with Cobra (Cavs Director of Team Operations, Mark Cashman) telling me that D-Wade, he wants number 9 and he's gonna talk to you. And then the second thing was I saw on Twitter somebody tweeted, like, you know: 'Wade is going to take No. 9 from Osman. He'll have to pick another number.' Stuff like that. But I was totally cool with it and he (Wade) was totally cool with it. It wasn't that big of issue. So, I was like: No problem, buddy. We swapped jerseys and that was it. So he took 9 and I picked 16 \u2013 just because has a '6' in it. It seemed like the veterans embraced you right away as an incoming rookie. Cedi: They did. I think it's just because I worked really hard and I was playing hard all the time. No matter what, if I got in for one minute or five minutes \u2013 especially that first year, minutes were really crucial for me \u2013 I played hard. And I think they just took me under their wing because I was really playing hard and I really showed them that I want to be a part of the team and help the team. All the veterans we had my first year were great character guys, great people. Whenever I asked about something, they were always ready to help me. They never told me: 'Go away, I don't want to talk right now.' They were always trying to explain things and teach me. So that's why I really feel lucky for that first season. I just thing was because my energy was matching with everybody. And that's why I felt like we had like a small brother-big brother relationship. I heard so much negative about the rookie year, but it really wasn't like that for me. Looking back, that could have been a different story. What do you remember about that fateful first practice against LeBron? Cedi: Yeah, I'll probably always remember that scene. (Laughs) It wasn't my first practice. Actually, it was my second. We practiced in the morning and the second one that night was a scrimmage. So we're just playing, and LeBron comes from the other end \u2013 I was guarding someone else \u2013 and he came running at full-sprint. And I saw him and I tried to, you know, move away. But it just happened so quick, he stepped on my foot and twisted his ankle. And that's really when I started being panicked, asking if he's good and everything. He went right from the court to the cold tub. And then we kept playing, obviously, but my mind was not there. My mind was on LeBron: If he's good, if he's gonna be able to play, if anything bad happened. We had games coming up right away, so I was very nervous. So as soon as I got subbed out, I went right to the to the trainer's room and he was in the cold tub. And I went there, asked him if he's good, you know, that I'm sorry. I said I tried to move, but he's just so fast. He was like: \u2018Don't worry about it. Keep playing hard. I like how you're playing, keep doing it.\u2019 How much did having a friendship with him help with your confidence? Cedi: For me, it was really special \u2013 being able to talk to him, practice with him and then play in games with him. And then just outside of the court, being able to sit at lunch and talk about stuff was really was really a big thing for me. So I'm really thankful. I really wasn't expecting something like that. But I'm glad that it happened. Did you hit the \u2018rookie wall\u2019 at any point during that season? Cedi: No, I really didn't. And that's also because of my teammates. I mean, it's a long season. It's not easy. But I really didn\u2019t hit it, and that's thanks to them. When I would have a bad game, especially Bron, would always be like: 'Keep your head up. You played hard and that's the most important thing. Doesn't matter if you miss or make shots. You played hard.' You really did have a charmed rookie season. Cedi: (laughs) I did! I really did. Did you at least have some kind of rookie initiation or anything? Cedi: I mean, donuts on a game day. That's kind of routine. I think Channing, one time he asked me to buy him an iPhone charger. Besides that, really nothing serious and nothing too tough. You know, just like: 'Buy me a toothbrush' or whatever. Simple things, it really wasn't hard for me. But you see me on the court, passing? I really like to share with my teammates! So, getting stuff for them was no big deal. It was good for me!

Despite a highlight-worthy performance from LeBron James, Denver was able to pull out the win as a result of dominance from the team\u2019s second unit and a fourth-quarter takeover from Nikola Joki\u0107. The virtual homecourt advantage also helped fuel Denver\u2019s victory in the game that featured six-minute quarters. The Nuggets were ice cold to begin the game as Los Angeles jumped out to a 12-5 lead in the opening minutes. However, in what became the story of the game, the Nuggets gained the advantage once the second unit entered the virtual hardwood. Monte Morris made an immediate impact by hitting several difficult jumpers, while Michael Porter Jr. completed an and-one layup to give Denver a 20-16 lead after one quarter of play. The story flipped once the Lakers\u2019 starters returned to the court in the second quarter, as James and Anthony Davis fueled the offense while Dwight Howard protected the rim on the defensive end. With Howard blocking shots on consecutive possessions, the Lakers were able to get out in transition and take a 34-31 lead into the halftime break. Los Angeles\u2019 lead jumped up to 41-33 early in the third quarter as James had two memorable dunks in transition. Once again, Denver relied on its second unit to get back into the game, which is exactly what happened in the latter stages of the third quarter. Morris entered the game and immediately dropped 5 points, while Torrey Craig and Mason Plumlee helped fuel transition opportunities with two blocks on the defensive end. As a result, Denver took a 53-51 lead into the final frame. The fourth quarter was a nail-biter. The virtual Nuggets and Lakers battled it out in a back-and-forth affair, as the two teams traded tough shot after tough shot. However, in what has become a trend for the real-life Nuggets, Joki\u0107 stepped up when his team needed him most. The two-time All-Star big man scored eight-straight points for Denver during the middle stages of the quarter and then wrapped up his dominant quarter by knocking down a contested floater over JaVale McGee which put Denver up 75-72 with 23 seconds remaining. On the ensuing possession, a quality contest from Gary Harris on a 3-point attempt from Danny Green prompted a miss which Joki\u0107 rebounded. From there, Denver used the charity stripe to seal the victory. Despite Joki\u0107\u2019s dominance late in the victory, Morris was rewarded as the player of the game as a result of his steady play throughout the first three quarters. It\u2019s hard to argue with that distinction, as Morris spearheaded a dominant performance from Denver\u2019s second unit, which outscored the Lakers\u2019 second unit by 21 points in the seven-point victory.

Terry Rozier paved the way for Charlotte with a game-high 30 points on 9-of-17 shooting (4-of-8 from three) and a season-high 10 rebounds in the victory. This marked the first 30-point, 10-rebound game of Rozier\u2019s NBA career and the first by any Hornet player so far this season. Charlotte converted a 13-point second-quarter deficit into a 68-66 advantage heading into the fourth after holding the Knicks to just 16 points in third. The Hornets grew the lead to 88-79 with 2:07 remaining, then caught a huge break on a coach\u2019s challenge that turned a possible four-point play for Marcus Morris Sr. into an offensive foul. New York hung around down the stretch, but Rozier calmly went 8-of-8 from the line over the final 40 seconds to seal the win. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks for many reasons,\u201d said Coach Borrego after the win. \u201cCome back from Paris, it was a difficult game, obviously with Kobe\u2019s death. I\u2019m proud of our guys. They hung in there. We didn\u2019t get off to a great start, but we hung in, showed some resiliency, stogetherness and we fought tonight and got a good win.\u201d Miles Bridges (15 points), Malik Monk (13), Willy Hernang\u00f3mez (12) and Cody Zeller (10) rounded out Charlotte\u2019s five double-figure scorers. Hernang\u00f3mez and Zeller each grabbed 10 rebounds for their first and eighth double-doubles of the season, respectively, while Devonte\u2019 Graham dished out a game-high 10 assists. Julius Randle (24 points) and Morris Sr. (23) each recorded 20-point games for the Knicks, who lost for the fifth time in six meetings with the Hornets. Elfrid Payton flirted with a triple-double, racking up 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists and Mitchell Robinson chipped in four points, 10 rebounds and a game-high five blocks off the bench. Charlotte won the rebounding battle, 51-41, which included a near season-high 16 offensive rebounds leading to 14 second-chance points. The Hornets shot just 38.6% from the field, but went 21-of-27 from the free-throw line and assisted on 13 of 16 made shots in the second half. Borrego added, \u201cObviously, we want to shoot better than 38.0%. Most nights, that\u2019s going to be tough to win an NBA game. To gut it out and make those winning-type plays to get you through a game is impressive. There were a lot of hustle plays going on out there \u2013 50-50 balls, offensive rebounds, loose balls, tipped balls. We just found a way to win tonight, bottom line.\u201d A two-game road trip will get underway on Thursday, Jan. 30 when the Hornets travel north to face the Washington Wizards starting at 7 PM EST.

Eichenberger, the Nuggets\u2019 head strength and conditioning coach, gathers the essentials. Yoga gear? Check. Yoga mat? Check. And then finally, he loads up a Zoom video conference with the players and the instructor and proceeds with the class. It\u2019s an atypical approach to fitness training for NBA players, but it\u2019s a sign of the times in the league\u2019s current COVID-19 reality. Eichenberger and Denver Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach Claus Antunes de Souza have to be creative in finding ways to keep the Nuggets fit while they wait through a period of uncertainty for the NBA to resume. It\u2019s a challenge Eichenberger has embraced despite some challenges. \u201c[The biggest challenge] is not having the guys around me, not being able to control what I usually control,\u201d Eichenberger explained to Nuggets.com in a phone interview. \u201cDuring the season, you\u2019re around these guys seven days a week. Now, you maybe Facetime them two or three times a week.\u201d Despite some of the logistical barriers that have emerged while practicing social distancing, Eichenberger has been active in curating individual workout plans for each of the Nuggets\u2019 14 players. All of the players received workout accessories from the team\u2019s strength and conditioning team and they have customized daily fitness videos sent to them through an app. While it isn\u2019t exactly the Nuggets\u2019 training facility at Pepsi Center, it is cutting edge all things considered. \u201cIt includes things like bodyweight [and conditioning] with a lot of band workouts,\u201d Forward Vlatko \u010can\u010dar told Nuggets.com of his daily regimen. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of workouts you can do without using weight. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s really good because if there\u2019s a certain exercise you don\u2019t know, there\u2019s like a video showing you how it\u2019s done. He just sends the exercise and I haven\u2019t once had to ask them [Eichenberger and Antunes de Souza] how it\u2019s done because everything is just so well explained in it.\u201d The extensive level of preparation and communication from Eichenberger has gained plenty of plaudits throughout the Nuggets\u2019 organization. \u201cFelipe [Eichenberger], our head strength coach, is doing a fantastic job of suggesting workouts and catching up with all of these guys,\u201d Team President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly said in an interview with Altitude SR.

Through the app, Eichenberger can see which players are performing the exercises and follow up with them during their video conferences to determine how to improve their approach. Sometimes, the intense energy, focus and attention to detail that has made him one of the most respected strength coaches in the league seeps through his calls. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it really, really difficult,\u201d \u010can\u010dar said jokingly. \u201cIf you normally bench like 10 times, he\u2019ll make you do with a band 30 times. I feel like I get way more tired with the bands then I do weightlifting.\u201d Although the current setup is well-prepared and constructed, Eichenberger admitted it all came through improvisation. He remembered when the initial rumblings and speculation over COVID-19 started to emerge in early March. He started to think of how it might affect the way he and Antunes de Souza would need to alter their strategy to adjust. Without many details, it was a difficult task. \u201cIt was hard to plan. We knew that something was going on. There were rumors everywhere,\u201d Eichenberger said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how bad it would be\u2026We were playing in Dallas [on March 11] when everything went down, when they shut down the NBA. I planning for the next game [against the Spurs on March 13].\u201d Initially, the NBA planned on allowing teams to use their facilities in small groups while practicing social distancing. As the pandemic got worse, the league shut down all team facilities to be a part of a nationwide effort to fight the coronavirus. Fortunately, for the Nuggets, Eichenberger thought ahead. \u201cI got ahead of the curve and started ordering bands and [workout] stuff for the guys,\u201d he said.  With millions in the country staying in their homes due to quarantine, those workout supplies are becoming increasingly hard to find.\u00a0\u00a0For Eichenberger, the consistent check-ins and group workouts aren\u2019t just about staying fit. With no set timetable on the NBA\u2019s return, he acknowledged there isn\u2019t much sense in being as intense as he would be during the season. Rather, he believes the activities give the Nuggets another way to stay connected in an uncertain time and build morale. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to keep in touch with the guys,\u201d he said. \u201c[The situation] is hard, but the main goal right now is to keep the guys moving. We don\u2019t know when this [the NBA] is going to come back. We don\u2019t know much of what\u2019s going to happen in the future. So, to force the guys to do a lot of things is pretty hard. It\u2019s hard because we don\u2019t have a hard date [of when the NBA is returning]\u2026[For me, it\u2019s like] \u2018Hey, [you] did three workouts this week, let\u2019s get four hard workouts this week.\u2019\u201d For professional athletes who have worked their entire lives to play in the NBA, the routine is vital. \u201cWe have a good group of guys and they are doing that,\u201d Eichenberger said.

On Thursday, the Nuggets will take on the Lakers in a simulated 2K contest that will feature staples from the stadium\u2019s game presentation team. Yes, that means you\u2019ll have Kyle Singer\u2019s trademark voice introducing Denver\u2019s ballplayers along with cameos from super mascot Rocky, and the Mile High City Dancers. Fans will also hear commentary from long-time announcers Chris Marlowe and Scott Hastings.  Here\u2019s what to expect out of the upcoming matchup: Projected starters: Nuggets (Overall Rating: 82): Jamal Murray (84), Gary Harris (76), Will Barton III (80), Paul Millsap (82) and Nikola Joki\u0107 (91) Lakers (Overall Rating: 82): Avery Bradley (74), Danny Green (76), LeBron James (97), Anthony Davis (96), JaVale McGee (80)  TUNE IN: 7 p.m. MT, Twitch  Three key storylines: Stars vs. Depth The Lakers have two of the highest-rated players in 2K in LeBron James (No. 1) and Anthony Davis (No. 6), while the Nuggets have one in Nikola Joki\u0107 (No. 10). Where the Nuggets might have the edge is in the rest of their starting lineup and bench.  Denver has a clear advantage at point guard, where Jamal Murray and Monte Morris (78) should be able to overcome Bradley and Rajon Rondo (77). Who guards LeBron and AD? The Nuggets have plenty of talented forwards in the game, with Will Barton III, Paul Millsap leading a group that also features Michael Porter Jr. (81), Jerami Grant (77), Torrey Craig (74) among others. They will need all of those players to slow down the Lakers\u2019 star duo. Fortunately, the Nuggets forwards provide a solid mix of versatility on both sides of the floor. The key will be how video game Coach Michael Malone manages the group.  Answering the What Ifs The Nuggets and Lakers were scheduled to conclude their season series on March 15 in Los Angeles. Prior to the NBA\u2019s hiatus due to COVID-19, the Lakers were leading the matchup 2-1. The finale would have showcased Denver fighting to keep its homecourt advantage in the first round against the best team in the NBA. Thursday\u2019s simulation provides a brief glimpse to see what might have happened. So, sit back and enjoy the Pepsi Center experience with fellow Nuggets fans on Twitch. This should be a nail-biter.  "}

Here\u2019s what he had to say: The trade deadline was something my national team teammate Goran Dragi\u0107 told me about when I finally joined the NBA at the start of the season. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to see guys looking at their phones a lot,\u201d he said. With so much happening at the start of my time in Denver, moving to another country, adjusting to a new team and teammates, I didn\u2019t really think anything of it at the time. But he was right. The new year came around and sure enough, there wasn\u2019t a single player in our locker room who wasn\u2019t paying attention to potential moves around the league. And it ramped up as the NBA\u2019s trade deadline of Feb. 6 got closer. It is really different from what players deal with in Europe. There are no trades in the European leagues. Not a single one. In leagues like Spain\u2019s Liga ACB, where I last played, player movement is very similar to what is done in soccer on the continent. Players get transferred, meaning sold between clubs. When a player is sold, his contract is essentially torn up and a new one is drafted. It\u2019s a system that allows players to move sometimes from team to team in the same league or between countries in different leagues, essentially. Occasionally, you might also see a player go on loan, which means his parent club will permit him to play for another club to get more playing time, but no trades. When this year\u2019s trade deadline came in, it was surreal to see everything unfold in real time. I had ties with Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez and Jarred Vanderbilt so it was tough to see all three leave in a trade on Feb. 4. Malik, I played with in my first summer league and was helpful in that transition. Juancho and Jarred were close friends, so they will be missed in the locker room. There were also some immediate challenges with the roster. We were dealing with injuries to several players when the trade happened and lost three rotation players after the first game of a back-to-back. With paperwork still being finalized, it would mean we\u2019d only be able to dress seven eligible players. That, however, leads to my favorite memory as an NBA player. I\u2019ve played in 14 NBA games in my rookie season and being part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d win against the Jazz on Feb. 5 easily stands out as the highlight so far. Despite being shorthanded, there was a quiet confidence about this game. The Nuggets hadn\u2019t won in Salt Lake City since 2013, but the team was calm heading into the matchup \u2013 we were all locked in. There was Jamal Murray, Nikola Joki\u0107, Gary Harris, Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig, P.J. Dozier and myself and we fought to the end. When we escaped with a 98-95 win, it was one of the best experiences I was able to be a part of. And, of course, if you\u2019re a Nuggets fan, you\u2019ve probably seen the famous picture of us on the plane back home. It made waves in Slovenia, though most people back people home just thought we had seven players on the team!   It was a valuable learning experience and I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019ve had a lot of those in my first season in Denver. This has been a good year to learn as much as I can about the NBA. Some might ask what the experience is like going from a player who had established minutes in Spain to one who has to prove himself in the NBA. But for me, even my stints in the G League with the Erie BayHawks are invaluable. I appreciated having a chance to go to Erie, Pa. and gain some confidence during my time there. I really enjoyed working with the coaches and players. Everyone accepted me with open arms and were super helpful. In the first couple of games, I was trying to get my rhythm and fit in. But then my teammates and coaches were like, \u2018Go for it!\u2019 All of a sudden, everything changed and I started to play well. For me, I look it at this way: My minutes aren\u2019t coming by themselves, I have to earn them. The more I pay attention to detail and improve, the easier the NBA is going to be when I do get more opportunities to play. Well, that\u2019s all I have you Nuggets fans this week. I hope you\u2019re staying safe through these times and I hope this blog provided some entertainment. Thanks for reading!  As told to Alex Labidou. "}

Malone opened the call by thanking the health care workers that have made countless sacrifices during these difficult times. \u201cI want to send a big thank you to our heroes,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThose heroes are obviously our health care workers that are out there every single day putting themselves in the line of fire. I want to give a huge shoutout to them because they truly are heroes. They\u2019re stepping up in a difficult time every single day. I want them to know that me and my family are thinking about them, as well as everyone in the Nuggets organization.\u201d Malone also congratulated former Nuggets GM Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas for his new position as EVP of Basketball Operations for the Chicago Bulls. \u201c(It was) a well-deserved honor for Art\u016bras to get the job in Chicago,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for Art\u016bras, I\u2019ve worked closely with him and have known him for a long time. I know he\u2019ll do a great job and will be sorely missed here in Denver.\u201d Malone was then asked a wide range of questions from media members, which allowed him to reveal some of the programs and communication methods that Denver has used to keep everyone connected during these difficult times. Here are three takeaways from Malone\u2019s media conference call. The Nuggets have continued to stay connected during the suspension Malone made sure to emphasize that the team has stayed in touch regularly throughout the past month or so. As Zoom calls have become prevalent across the U.S. workforce, the same can be said for the Nuggets, as the team even had a team-wide call Tuesday morning that included all 16 players, the coaching staff and members of the front office. Additionally, Malone revealed that the team has an app that allows the strength and conditioning staff to send players workouts. The app also tracks which players have viewed and completed the workouts, which has been helpful for players who don\u2019t have access to personal gyms or training equipment. \u201cYou have to get creative,\u201d Malone said. \u201cFelipe Eichenberger and his staff have done a great job of engaging our players on a daily basis. Some guys have gotten Peloton bikes to have some sort of conditioning in case you can\u2019t get outside. Then some players are going out and running, hiking, etc.\u201d Yet at the same time, the uncertainty surrounding the timeline of the suspension can make it difficult on players and their training habits. \u201cWe are having a Zoom meeting with the training staff tomorrow to talk about the ramp-up,\u201d Malone revealed. \u201cWhenever we are allowed to get back in (to the training facilities), I\u2019ve heard it could be roughly 25-30 days to ramp up.\u201d Mental health has also been a focus for Malone and the Nuggets However, it isn\u2019t just about ensuring that the players have stayed in peak physical shape during the suspension. Given the need for social distancing and social isolation, players can often find themselves in situations with little-to-no personal contact for days or weeks on end. As a result, Malone and the Nuggets organization placed an emphasis on ensuring that the players\u2019 mental health is also strong. \u201cDuring these unprecedented times, it\u2019s also about how everyone is doing mentally,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI stay in touch with our players because communication allows us to feel better about ourselves. Mentally, it\u2019s about if you\u2019re staying engaged and in a positive mindset.\u201d Malone also revealed that the team has used several Zoom calls to bring in doctors to discuss mental wellbeing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about basketball, it\u2019s also about your own personal wellbeing,\u201d Malone expressed. There has been a mix of in-season and draft preparation Given the uncertainty surrounding the remaining 2019-20 season and how the COVID-19 virus will impact the 2020-21 season, the Nuggets\u2019 coaching staff and front office has had to strike a balance between preparing for the potential resumption of the 2019-20 season and ensuring that the team is ready to make a calculated pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Unlike in 2019, the Nuggets are slated to have a first-round pick in this year\u2019s draft as a result of the four-team trade that was completed at the 2019 trade deadline. Denver will receive Houston\u2019s first-round pick in this year\u2019s draft, which was slated as 21st overall selection when the season was suspended. As a result, Malone said he has had calls with the front office to look over available film on potential prospects in the 2020 draft to ensure Denver is prepared for whenever the draft takes place.

It's been a while since I wrote one of these, but I wanted to check in on a few things. Dealing with the Coronavirus On my end, I've tried to find ways to stay engaged and active both mentally and physically. The Nuggets training staff, which is led by Felipe Eichenberger and Claus Antunes de Souza, have been in touch with us and are giving us daily workout plans to our phones. I've also gone to parks where there aren't any people around to do some activities outside. Just to have a reason to go outside of the house from time to time. I have a lot of energy and it would be a shame to just waste it by staying home. Although social distancing can be challenging for anyone, Denver is significantly different from what some countries around the world are dealing with. For example, back in my country of Slovenia, there are police-enforced quarantine and curfews with designated times where you can go to the supermarket. I've appreciated having the opportunity to step outside when I can and continue to learn more about this city. When I officially joined the Nuggets and moved to Denver, I made the decision to find a place to live on my own and embrace adapting to a new life in the United States. Since the season was placed on hiatus, I\u2019ve changed my sleep schedule so I can stay closely connected with my friends and family back home. I'll wake up at 7:30 am every day and do a video conference with them. I've also managed to stay in touch with my Nuggets teammates. Have you seen Nikola Joki\u0107's beard? Ha, I think he should shave it immediately! On a side note, I can't grow a beard. Despite many attempts and early excitement, it never pans out. So, I'm on the other end of the spectrum, any little hair is getting shaved every five days. But back to chatting with teammates, it's good to stay connected and see how everyone is doing. Finally, in my attempts to stay sane during this period, I've started to learn how to play the piano and I'm taking lessons on my phone to pick up Japanese. Hopefully, when things get back to normal, I'll finally get a chance to visit Japan. Kon'nichiwa T\u014dky\u014d! Call of Duty and Netflix have also been very helpful! On Art\u016bras leaving for Chicago As I'm sure most of you are aware, Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas is heading to Chicago for a well-deserved opportunity as the Bulls' new Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations. I wanted to, first of all, say thank you to Arturas for being a true mentor to me since I became a part of the Nuggets franchise. I obviously knew of Arturas from his playing days in Europe. He's is one of the best, if not the best, European players to not have played in the NBA. He played for huge clubs in Europe and was an icon on the continent. For me, considering that success, it made it all the more impressive how he treated me when I was drafted by the Nuggets. He was an awesome guy and helped me with everything that I needed. He made me feel like a part of the family right away. Once I got here in Denver, he was talking to me all of the time and giving me advice. With all of the adjustments I've made over the past year, it helped me stay positive. Whenever there were negative situations, he would find a way to be uplifting. I will miss him here but I'm happy for him. I wish him the best of luck. Alright everyone, that's all I got for you for now. Next week, I'll check with a new blog discussing trades and my favorite NBA moment. Check it out! As told to Alex Labidou "}

In a regulation loss in San Antonio, Denver mustered 154 points, which included two quarters in which the Nuggets scored at least 40 points. Eight players scored in double-figures for Denver, led by the team\u2019s all-time leading scorer Alex English, who dropped 30 points on 15-of-22 shooting from the field. As a team, Denver shot 55.5 percent from the field and made 29 of 32 from the charity stripe. In shocking contrast to today\u2019s NBA, the Nuggets attempted just six 3-pointers on the night, connecting on three of them. Meanwhile, the Spurs missed their only attempt from beyond the arc. San Antonio had nine players in double-figures on the final night of the regular season. This 1983-84 Nuggets team was known for high-scoring games that were played at a fast pace. Over the course of the season, Denver ranked first in points per game (second in offensive rating) and first in pace. This style of play became a common theme for Nuggets teams coached by Doug Moe. Despite finishing the 1983-84 season with a 38-44 record, Denver was able to make the playoffs, where it fell to the Utah Jazz in the first round. However, the Nuggets made the Western Conference Finals the following season. Interestingly enough, this 154-point performance is only tied for the eighth-highest scoring game in Nuggets history, led by the team\u2019s 184-point performance against the Detroit Pistons which occurred in the same 1983-84 season. If you liked offense, then this era of the Nuggets was certainly for you. To learn more about Doug Moe\u2019s coaching style and Denver\u2019s offensive strategies during this era, click below. "}

It was one of the first days of the Boys &amp; Girls Club\u2019s experiment with virtual afterschool programs. The improvisation came after the closing of eight facilities throughout southeast Michigan to adhere to Michigan\u2019s social distancing orders issued by Gov. Whitmer in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Wilson, the non-profit\u2019s president and CEO, was observing the video conferencing session when a mother appeared. Leaning over her wheelchair-bound child, she had a simple message. Thank you. Wilson realized that a virtual component is needed for those unable to attend facilities and the program needs to continue even when society returns to normal. Wilson recalled her presence Wednesday afternoon \u2013 one day before the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan virtual club takeover, a fundraiser that featured a group effort from the Detroit Pistons, Detroit rapper Big Sean, Atlanta rapper Ludacris, lieutenant governor Garlin Gilchrist, the three other Detroit pro sports teams and other celebrities. \u201cIt was like this \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment where I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, this is something that we need to continue to build out no matter what so all the proceeds are going to allow us to do those things,\u201d he said. Piston Langston Galloway and former Piston Rick Mahorn represented the franchise in the event supported by Zoom, the video conferencing company that\u2019s become well-known over the last few weeks. The non-profit announced the event was successful in raising $300,000 (and counting) by selling sponsorships, well more than the goal of $100,000. The event started with youths dancing to sounds provided by a local DJ Todd Everett. Pistons dancers joined in. Kids help up signs of support. During the event, Pistons mascot Hooper joined with other mascots to serve as hype men. Celebrities like NFL great Jerome Bettis, actor Harper Hill and members of pro sports teams played games to entertain youths who tuned in. Big Sean and Ludacris gave motivational speeches. In the last game of the event, Galloway and Mahorn went against Detroit Red Wings Madison Bowey and Brendan Perlini in a name-that-song contest, a Little Caesars Arena battle. The Red Wings easily defeated the Pistons. Like many non-profits, the Boys &amp; Girls Club saw fundraisers cancelled over the last few weeks. One of the main sources of revenue is the North American International Auto Show\u2019s charity gala, which was cancelled because the event\u2019s site, the TCF Center, has been converted into a field hospital for COVID-19 patients. A golf outing was unable to be held. With facilities closed, rental fees have dried up. But the need remains. That\u2019s why after facilities closed March 13, the organization pivoted to virtual clubs, which allows kids to remain in contact with friends and staff. It also provides an outlet for those who previously couldn\u2019t attend clubs. \u201cIf the kid doesn\u2019t have the transportation to get to the club or if there\u2019s some kind of physical impairment that prevents them from getting to the club, we should be there for them, to give them another option. \u201cSo we will have an online and offline option moving forward,\u201d Wilson said. The non-profit is planning for a return to normalcy. Wilson estimates more than 60% of parents using the club\u2019s childcare services are considered essential workers. Initial efforts will be aimed to help those parents with plans to open one or two facilities. Wilson also anticipates the organization providing all-day childcare services in May and June, a bit earlier than usual because so many other youth groups are idled indefinitely. Wilson said all re-opening efforts will be done safely. \u201cIt\u2019s all for the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s powerful because I think so often during national crises \u2013 or in this case a global crisis \u2013 kids are often thought about second, or further down the totem pole.\u201d "}

Even in good draft classes, expectations for the 23rd pick are modest. In drafts considered thin, weak at the top or both, you\u2019re lucky if the 23rd pick sees the floor \u2013 or sticks in the league long enough to see a second contract. The 2002 draft was considered both \u2013 lacking in star power and in depth. In retrospect \u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t a bad take. Yao Ming wound up going No. 1 over Duke guard Jay Williams, the only two players in the draft considered to have superstar ceilings. But there were grave concerns about both of them. So much was unknown about Yao other than his incredible size \u2013 7-foot-6 and 300-plus pounds. He was from China, which had never produced an NBA player of any consequence \u2013 and, beyond Yao, still hasn\u2019t nearly two decades after he was the driving force in making the NBA an intensely popular pastime in a nation of 1.4 billion. Foot injuries cut short Yao\u2019s career after eight seasons during which he flashed dominant traits. He still proved the definitively better choice over Williams, whose career ended in a catastrophic motorcycle accident after a thoroughly unimpressive rookie season in Chicago. Joe Dumars, two years into his run as Pistons president of basketball operations at the time, was just hoping to fortify a team in transition. Later that summer, he would make two franchise-altering decisions \u2013 to sign Chauncey Billups as a free agent and to trade leading scorer Jerry Stackhouse, one year ahead of his contract\u2019s expiration, for a young Rip Hamilton. For that draft, he was just hoping to land someone who could contribute at some point. At 23 in a disparaged draft, he knew it would be a flawed prospect. In Tayshaun Prince, the flaw was obvious: his physique. No player in America was more visible in that draft than Prince. He\u2019d spent four years in Kentucky\u2019s starting lineup, seeing his scoring average go up each season. He played in 135 college games. But he appeared so gangly and thin, bordering on frail, that there was natural suspicion about his ability to endure the rigors of an NBA season. Dumars needed to see just how tough Prince was. So he enlisted Scotty Perry, now Knicks general manager but then his chief college scout, to find the roughest, toughest defender in college basketball to challenge Prince when he visited the Pistons for a predraft workout. Perry came up with Randy Holcomb from San Diego State. \u201cRandy played on the wild side,\u201d Perry told me after Prince had established himself as an NBA starter. \u201cVery strong, very athletic, kind of throws his body all around.\u201d And that\u2019s what he did during his workout against Prince, just as Dumars hoped. \u201cA physical small forward,\u201d Dumars recalled of Holcomb. \u201cStrong as a bull. He jammed Tayshaun into the basket one time, just \u2026 BAM! And Tayshaun dropped to the floor.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re matched up in a one-on-one drill,\u201d Perry said. \u201cTayshaun goes to the rim and Randy just knocked the heck out of him. Knocked him into the basket support. Tayshaun hit it hard and then he hit the floor hard, laid there. And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh, geez, I sure hope he\u2019s not hurt.\u2019 \u201d Prince came to the workout already dealing with back pain. He\u2019d had several workouts earlier in that week and the day before, a Thursday, he\u2019d been asked to do drills with a medicine ball for the Chicago Bulls. \u201cI got to Detroit, woke up the next morning and my back was all messed up,\u201d Prince remembered. \u201cOnce Randy fouled me and I fell into the basket support \u2026 my back was already tight, as it was.\u201d How Prince responded to that moment sealed his future with the Pistons. \u201cAnd then he popped up. And he said, \u2018All right, let\u2019s go,\u2019 \u201d Dumars said. \u201cAnd I looked around and said, \u2018That\u2019s my guy. That\u2019s my guy right there.\u2019 \u201d \u201cHe gets up, checks the ball to Randy \u2013 because he\u2019s still on offense \u2013 and he went right back at the basket,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI was sold. Ninety percent of guys playing probably would have settled on a jump shot and not challenged him. When he did that, that answered any questions right there.\u201d Dumars whipped out his phone and called Prince\u2019s agent, letting him know that he wasn\u2019t getting past the 23rd pick. But in a draft with so few sure things, how likely was he to get there? As the draft neared, the Pistons fretted Prince would go to Houston at 15 or to Phoenix at 22, one spot ahead of them. Instead, here were the 10 players picked immediately ahead of Prince: Marcus Haislip, Fred Jones, Bostjan Nachbar, Jiri Welsch, Juan Dixon, Curtis Borchardt, Ryan Humphrey, Kareem Rush, Qyntel Woods and Casey Jacobsen. (Any further questions about the strength or depth of the 2002 draft?) Prince, now a highly regarded executive for the Memphis Grizzlies, played 14 seasons and more NBA games (1,017) than the five players drafted immediately ahead of him combined \u2013 and more than anyone else in the 2002 draft class. He led the draft class in assists, was fourth in scoring and eighth in rebounding. And as he goes about his job scouting college players now, he probably hears his own words echoing in his head as he recalled the skepticism with which scouts viewed him: \u201cIt all boils down to, can a guy play basketball? I don\u2019t care how big or how little a guy is. If he can play the game, he can play the game.\u201d "}

First up: Game 6 of the 2004 second round against the New Jersey Nets.) It was the most celebrated play in the 29-year history of The Palace of Auburn Hills: a 3-pointer from just inside the half-court line to force overtime in a high-stakes playoff game. But the banked triple that made certain Chauncey Billups would always be known as Mr. Big Shot didn\u2019t wind up leading to a Pistons win. And for about 48 agonizing hours, it threatened to become nothing more than a footnote to a painful loss that pushed the Pistons to the brink of playoff elimination. After enduring that exhausting triple-overtime loss on May 14 in Game 5 of a second-round series, the Pistons had to travel the next day, a Saturday, back to New Jersey. The Nets \u2013 reigning Eastern Conference champions \u2013 had already spanked the Pistons there twice in a series where home court appeared to mean everything. Before that epic triple-overtime thriller, the Nets had won by 18 and 15 at the Meadowlands and the Pistons by the same margins, 18 and 15, at The Palace. (And those margins were especially lopsided considering the defensive nature of the games and of the era. Consider: Other than the triple-overtime game, neither team hit triple digits in any game of that series. In the six other games, the winning team scored 78, 95, 82, 94, 81 and 90 points \u2013 and the losing team scored in the 50s once, the 60s twice and the 70s twice.) So everything screamed a New Jersey win on that Sunday evening in mid-May. Home court, momentum, the history of the series, the emotional toll of that crushing Game 6 loss at home on the heels of the euphoria that enveloped The Palace when Billups\u2019 miracle shot forced overtime \u2013 everything pointed to a New Jersey romp and the Pistons season closing where it had ended 12 months earlier in the conference finals. And the game\u2019s opening segment only reinforced prevailing wisdom. The Nets jumped to a 13-4 lead after five minutes. The precision with which Larry Brown\u2019s offense executed and relied upon was blunted by the familiarity the Nets had gained by playing the Pistons so often and by the physicality of the games. (In the 3OT game, all Pistons starters except Billups fouled out as the Nets shot 55 free throws, all of which made Brown livid.) The chances of a comeback seemed remote midway through the first quarter with a bloodthirsty crowd at full throat. But the Pistons came back to cut the deficit to two after a quarter and dominated the second quarter, 27-11, to lead by 14 at halftime. The Nets dominated the third almost as thoroughly to pull within three headed to the fourth quarter and it was anybody\u2019s game in the final minute. That\u2019s when the endless repetition and flawless execution Brown demanded paid off. On two half-court possessions with their season on the line, the Pistons produced the type of shot Brown\u2019s offense was designed to get \u2013 the kind of shot eschewed by every team in today\u2019s NBA where layups and 3-point shots are the holy grail and mid-range shots are to be avoided at all costs. With the game tied in the final minute, the Pistons twice ran Hamilton around a series of screens \u2013 from Tayshaun Prince and Ben Wallace on the right side and Rasheed Wallace on the left, the pressure point where the play was designed to yield its opportunity. On the first, the Pistons got a switch \u2013 Jason Kidd going off of Hamilton and on to Rasheed Wallace, who scored on a 12-foot turnaround over the Nets star guard. After Richard Jefferson tied the game again, the Nets the next time avoided the switch; Hamilton, given just enough breathing room as Kidd moved around Rasheed Wallace\u2019s screen, drained a bloodless jumper with 15 seconds to play. \u201cI knew I could shoot over the top of him,\u201d Hamilton said after the 81-75 win. \u201cI just tried to get to a spot. I thought I got fouled on the play, too.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s irrepressible scoring ability was the lifeblood of the Pistons offense during that playoff run. In a game where every half-court possession was a Greco-Roman wrestling match, Hamilton scored 24 of their 81 points in the win that set up the 2004 title run. Brown\u2019s bench was also instrumental that night. Mehmet Okur played 21 minutes \u2013 three more than Prince \u2013 as the Pistons struggled to contain Jefferson, who led New Jersey with 23 points. And Lindsey Hunter scored eight points in just nine minutes, hitting 2 of 3 3-pointers on a night the Pistons made only five for the game. There were rumblings that Kidd had injured his knee in that draining triple-OT Game 5, though he played 45 minutes in the Game 6 loss at less than his typical level of impact, finishing with 11 points and eight assists. With the series headed back to The Palace for Game 7 two nights later, all the things that made the Nets a prohibitive favorite for Game 6 \u2013 momentum, home court, psyche \u2013 now switched sides. The Pistons didn\u2019t squander their advantages, routing the Nets 90-69. Kidd, clearly under par, went scoreless in 42 minutes, shooting 0 of 8. Billups and Hamilton combined for 43 points. Nobody had to make any miracle threes or clutch jumpers this time. And the Pistons were on to the conference finals \u2013 a series that would be even more physical and defense-dominant \u2013 against the Indiana Pacers. "}

In the meantime, Pistons fans have some questions about the draft, Sekou Doumbouya and Bruce Brown in this week\u2019s edition of Pistons Mailbag. Dishon (Westland, Mich.): If the Pistons get a top-four pick, what are the chances of drafting LaMelo Ball if he declares for the draft? Langlois: It\u2019s not a year where there is a consensus top one or two players with a big dropoff to the next tier, though Ball is pretty consistently considered among the top three or four. Whether that means the Pistons see him that way is anyone\u2019s guess. I can guarantee you that a year ago, there was near unanimity that Zion Williamson and Ja Morant were the top two players. Ed Stefanski told me recently that the Pistons did have one of their international scouts see Ball play last fall before suffering a foot injury that ended his season in Australia after playing in just 12 games. They were a fairly impressive 12 games other than poor shooting percentages, though: Ball averaged 17 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists as an 18-year-old playing against men on the other side of the world. At 6-foot-7, he\u2019s got tremendous size at point guard. The biggest question with Ball is his perimeter shot. Put aside the fact the Pistons need help at point guard \u2013 Derrick Rose is their only point guard under contract for next season and it\u2019s the last year of his deal \u2013 and that Dwane Casey loves playing multiple point guards. The Pistons will draft the player they feel has the brightest NBA future. But given the value at that position, it figures that the Pistons would lean point guard if all else is equal. So to your question, Ball makes as much or more sense for the Pistons than anyone \u2013 if, indeed, they see in Ball a future NBA difference maker. James Vos (@JamesVos): How many games will Sekou start next season? Langlois: If Blake Griffin stays healthy, it could be a scant few. I think Doumbouya has enough positional versatility so that he could defend small forwards comfortably down the road, but for now I think he\u2019s best suited to guard power forwards. And the Pistons have another season with Tony Snell, a player Dwane Casey has confidence in defensively. Snell and Griffin are most likely to be the starting forwards. Doumbouya will have the opportunity to get plenty of minutes at either spot behind them if he\u2019s up to it. This was going to be a big summer developmentally for Doumbouya \u2013 both in skills work and strength and conditioning. You can bet that whenever the all-clear comes to resume workouts, the Pistons will ramp up quickly with Doumbouya and their other young players. And when the off-season arrives, they\u2019ll have an aggressive program for him. Adam (St. Petersburg, Fla.): If the Pistons stay where they are in the draft, fifth, what do you think is their likeliest outcome on draft night? Langlois: LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman are about as close as you\u2019ll get to a consensus top three this year, though if you give me even odds I\u2019d bet that at least one of them will be available with the No. 4 pick. But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say those three are gone by the time the No. 5 pick rolls around. Logic would point you in the direction of point guard given (a) that\u2019s the deepest position at the top of the draft with four of the top 10 and seven of the top 15 prospects in ESPN.com\u2019s current top 100 rankings listed at point guard, (b) it\u2019s an acute position of need for the Pistons, (c) Dwane Casey loves to play multiple point guards and (d) the NBA tilts to point guards now given the premium on penetration and playmaking to create the kinds of shots, layups and 3-pointers, that all offenses attempt to create. Given that the Pistons drafted two European teenagers last year, I think you\u2019d have to look at the two French point guards, Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon, with Hayes generally rated higher. Cole Anthony is another generally rated in that range. But there are plenty of other intriguing guards and beauty will be firmly in the eye of the beholder in this draft. Some might fall in love with Tyrese Maxey or Kira Lewis or Devin Dotson, though it might be a stretch for any of them to go in the top five (or six or seven if the Pistons get jumped by teams in the lottery). If the Pistons aren\u2019t sold on any of the point guards that high in the draft, then I could see them filling that position with free-agent veterans on short-term deals. It will be imperative to get a player they see as a long-term building block, no matter the position. Deni Avdija of Israel is a playmaking wing with great size who also figures to be attractive and might prove to be the best player available if he\u2019s there at five (or six or seven). Philip (Negaunee, Mich.): The NFL draft is going on as scheduled this week. What are the odds the NBA draft goes on as scheduled on June 25? Langlois: Big difference: The NFL season was finished back in early February and the draft order was long ago determined. Nothing is certain given the vast uncertainty of worldwide conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic, but it seems certain that the NBA draft won\u2019t be held until some time after the conclusion of the NBA season \u2013 and no one knows when that might be. Adam Silver has said the NBA would make no determinations until May 1, but we\u2019re just a little more than a week away from that date and, given that there\u2019s still no unanimity of opinion on when it might be safe to eat at a restaurant again \u2013 never mind OK for the travel and congregation that an NBA game would demand, even one held without fans \u2013 I don\u2019t anticipate Silver making any sweeping declarations on May 1. The logical assumption is that the draft will come a week or so after the conclusion of the NBA Finals \u2013 if the NBA determines it can resume the season in any capacity. If the NBA were to make the determination that the season cannot proceed \u2013 a decision that will be put off as long as possible \u2013 then the draft could be staged at any point. Al (Wolverine Lake, Mich.): Did the Bruce Brown as point guard experiment die? Langlois: Like the NBA season, it was suspended. Like the NBA season, to be determined if it will be picked up again. Before Derrick Rose injured his ankle in the March 1 loss at Sacramento, Dwane Casey said he wanted Brown to spend the rest of the season off the ball in order to allow him to focus more on that role. He didn\u2019t explicitly say so, but I suspect he was saying that playing point guard had become enough of a mental and physical burden for Brown that it was affecting his ability to be an impact player in the areas where Brown\u2019s true value lies \u2013 being an elite perimeter defender and lending an aura of toughness to his team. There\u2019s value in Brown having the ability to play point guard and there are carryover traits that Brown developed while playing point guard that will make him a better shooting guard because of it. My guess is that the Pistons will have Derrick Rose and two other no-doubt point guards on the roster to start next season with Brown available in a pinch. But Casey wants at least two and preferably three guys on the floor who can put the ball on the floor with enough authority that the defense is forced to respond to them. Luke Kennard isn\u2019t a point guard but he can make plays off the dribble. Svi Mykhailiuk was making great strides in that department \u2013 he had four or more assists in five of his last six games before the suspension of the season \u2013 as he got more experience. So I think Brown\u2019s time as a point guard will be limited going forward, but it was still beneficial for his (and the Pistons\u2019) future to have had the experience.

Do we use it wisely? Do you use it on players? Do you use it on collecting assets? Different avenues. It\u2019s great to have it and now use it wisely and make the right choices.\u201d Only two franchises, Atlanta and New York, project to have more cap space this off-season \u2013 whenever it gets here \u2013 than the Pistons. Only seven others will have cap space, period. The best weapon most teams will take to free agency will be the mid-level exception and some won\u2019t even have the full power of that. There are always elements of chaos and calculation to free agency. Are you better off immediately pursuing high-end targets where the cost is certain to escalate as multiple suitors drive up the price or to focus on a compatible player from a lesser tier against fewer competitors? Are you better off simply waiting out a game of musical chairs, capitalizing to find value buys as cap space around the league is exhausted? The uncertainty is amplified this year by current conditions. The salary cap and everything that falls under it \u2013 from maximum contracts to values for the mid-level and other exceptions \u2013 is determined by a formula based on league revenue. Nobody knows yet how or if the NBA will adjust the figures that formula produces this season given diminished revenue, which complicates the war-room projections teams almost certainly have undertaken to make use of their down time. How that affects either end of the options Stefanski enumerated for how to allocate their cap space \u2013 using it to acquire free agents or taking on contracts other teams are looking to move while acquiring draft capital in return \u2013 remains to be seen. Taking on contracts with a tighter cap and reduced tax threshold, if that eventuates, could mean a bigger bounty in draft capital coming back than typical, making that an attractive option. Put another way, teams feeling a more urgent need to offload contracts logically figure to be more willing to attach greater value. At the same time, a player who might have expected offers well above the mid-level exception \u2013 anticipated to be $9.75 million only a few months ago \u2013 now might come at a bargain price. So, Stefanski said, the Pistons will go into free agency with all options on the table and a level of preparedness that will allow them to seize opportunity in whatever form it presents itself. \u201cI\u2019ve been in so many markets. To go into free agency and have a plan and once free agency starts, the plan gets blown up,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cWe have numerous plans and different scenarios that could occur. We have to use this money wisely. What makes the most sense to us? We\u2019re asking those questions now. What makes the most sense for the Pistons now?\u201d The Pistons will go into the off-season with pronounced needs at point guard and center. Christian Wood will be an unrestricted free agent with the Pistons holding early Bird rights. They could sign Wood with cap space or use space elsewhere and then sign Wood using an exception for early Bird free agents, which stipulates that the Pistons could offer 105 percent of the average NBA salary for 2019-20. That means the Pistons could offer Wood a first-year salary of roughly $10 million \u2013 or slightly more than the projected mid-level exception. Derrick Rose is the only point guard on the roster under contract for next season. The top of the draft could help address the need at point guard with four of the top 10 and seven of the top 15 prospects in ESPN\u2019s rankings at that position. There\u2019s long been discussion that the NBA calendar should reverse the order of the draft and free agency so that free agency comes first, as it does in the NFL. Anything and everything seems possible for the off-season ahead. Stefanski doesn\u2019t have a strong preference either way. \u201cThe league is always looking for new ideas and thinking of different ways,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201c(Commissioner) Adam Silver is great at that. I just don\u2019t know with what\u2019s happening right now, trying to see if there\u2019s some light at the end of the tunnel, some thoughts the league could come up with. Whatever it comes up with, I\u2019m fine with working either way.\u201d "}

Although the 1988-89 season neared the end of that era of the Nuggets (Moe would depart in 1990 and Denver missed the playoffs the next three seasons following a nine-year streak of reaching the postseason), the Nuggets produced one of the most memorable offensive performances in franchise history on this day in 1989. In a 139-121 victory over the Golden State Warriors, Denver racked up a franchise-record 52 assists. The ball movement was spearheaded by Fat Lever, who posted a franchise-record 21 assists himself. For reference, the Warriors accumulated 25 assists as a team on that April night. Lever also chipped in 15 points, 13 rebounds and five steals in the dynamic performance. In stark contrast to today\u2019s high-scoring games, the Nuggets attempted just one 3-pointer in this game, which was knocked down by Darwin Cook. Denver shot 57.5 percent from the field and went 16-of-21 from the charity stripe to fuel the high-scoring outing. Given the team\u2019s offensive system during the 1980s, it\u2019s no surprise to see that the four highest assist outputs in franchise history came during this decade. In 1987, the Nuggets dished out 47 assists in a 147-120 victory over the Sacramento Kings, while Denver accumulated 46 assists in the well-known 186-184 loss to the Detroit Pistons in 1983. That game still stands as the highest-scoring game in NBA history. In 1982, the Nuggets racked up 45 assists in a 130-116 victory over the New Jersey Nets. Led by Fat Lever and Alex English throughout most of the 1980s, the Nuggets lit up the scoreboard regularly and made the playoffs in each season from 1982 to 1990. An additional fun fact from this April 21 game in 1989 is that Manute Bol, father of Denver\u2019s Bol Bol, played 13 minutes for Golden State. Bol would go on to lead the league in blocks per game (4.3) for the second time in his career. "}

Some or most of them will be instrumental in taking the next steps as they launch a rebuilding phase. Stefanski picked up Christian Wood off waivers. He\u2019s drafted Sekou Doumbouya, Bruce Brown, Khyri Thomas, Jordan Bone and Deividas Sirvydis, the latter still ripening in Europe as a 19-year-old. He\u2019s traded for Svi Mykhailiuk and Thon Maker. And he signed Donta Hall as an undrafted free agent and stashed him in Grand Rapids before giving him two 10-day contracts just before the NBA season was suspended March 11. Stefanski also inherited Luke Kennard, a 10th Piston in the under-25 club. But you could argue that the fate of the Pistons will be determined more by players not currently on the roster than those who are. Stefanski knows how critical every move \u2013 every draft pick, every trade, every free-agent deal, every waiver claim \u2013 is to keep the rebuilding on track and prevent it from becoming a prolonged ordeal. So like millions of others, Stefanski has spent an inordinate amount of time on streaming devices in the nearly six weeks since the NBA pulled the plug amid the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike those millions, he\u2019s not bingeing Netflix but scouring draft and free-agent prospects. No one knows quite yet how the NBA calendar will be affected \u2013 commissioner Adam Silver has said that no clarity will come before May 1 at the earliest, though Stefanski said \u201cthat\u2019s not a magic date\u201d \u2013 but if the draft and free agency go off in late June as planned, the Pistons will be armed and ready. \u201cYeah, I think if June 25 (the date of the draft) rolled around, there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019d be prepared,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cMaybe in a different manner. Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t have live workouts. We would have to do more virtual \u2013 virtual interviews with players \u2013 and we\u2019d get the medical done, I\u2019d think, in all different cities. But we\u2019re ready to adapt. We\u2019ve talked about many different scenarios that could happen. I feel comfortable with whatever.\u201d There\u2019s the possibility \u2013 and perhaps the likelihood \u2013 that the draft will be pushed back, depending on how the NBA proceeds with the completion of its regular season and the implementation of the playoffs, whether in standard or revised format. The Pistons had played 66 of 82 scheduled regular-season games when the season was suspended. If the season resumes, the expectation is that the draft \u2013 and certainly free agency \u2013 would coincide with the end of the playoffs. Free agency would require less adaptation for NBA front offices than a draft that might have to proceed without a combine \u2013 it was set for late May \u2013 or individual workouts at team sites. \u201cWe have plenty on that,\u201d Stefanski said of free agency. Pretty much all the hay was already in the barn with respect to the college basketball season and the scouting of its players. Stefanski said it might have been helpful to see a few late movers play in their conference tournaments and the NCAA tournament beyond that, but most players had put in an ample body of work already. The Pistons scouting staff \u2013 four assigned to scout colleges under the direction of personnel director Gregg Polinsky \u2013 had all put eyes on most draftable prospects multiple times. Video of their games have been scoured over the past month-plus. Polinsky was pulled off the road ahead of a planned European scouting trip as the coronavirus spread was escalating but before the NBA suspended its season. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s been compromised is myself and Gregg getting over to Europe,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cWe were over there early in the season, but had planned an additional trip. Gregg\u2019s trip was happening before this began and there was a lot of talk about it so we took him off that trip and thank God we did. We took all our scouts off the (conference) tournaments right away, hoping we could help them, but Maury Hanks, our scout, got it anyway. He\u2019s made a very nice recovery, thankfully. But we have enough.\u201d The Pistons have three international scouts, as well. Of the current ESPN top 10 prospects, two played in Europe (Deni Avdija of Israel and Killian Hayes of France) and two Americans (LaMelo Ball, R.J. Hampton) played in Australia and New Zealand. Both Ball and Hampton\u2019s seasons ended prematurely, but Stefanski said the Pistons had scouts in to see both. \u201cWe were fortunate that a scout was over there early in the season,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had someone\u2019s eyes on all the players, even the ones that were in New Zealand, Australia and over in Europe.\u201d Preparation for the 2021 draft might be affected more negatively by the restrictions in place and event cancellations than the 2020 draft, in fact. If summer evaluation camps and international competitions are eliminated, a key link in the information chain will go missing. \u201cIt would. That\u2019s a good question,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to probably see the summer stuff you would see going forward, but I guess I look at it like the whole league is in the same boat. You have to adapt and have to figure ways out. It\u2019s just the way it is. I don\u2019t get concerned over it if it\u2019s out of your control.\u201d As for what\u2019s in their control, Stefanski and his staff adjusted quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a ton,\u201d he said. \u201cLike everyone in the league, we\u2019re doing a ton of video. We don\u2019t know exactly where we\u2019re going to draft, but we\u2019re going to be in the top end. We have a lot of film studies where we get on conference calls and Zoom and work out our thoughts as a group. This is done on the draft and free agency. Honestly, I can say all of us living in different areas and not going in the office, we\u2019re getting a lot of work done, maybe as much or more done. I feel very comfortable on that.\u201d "}

Such is the mystique of Michael Jordan. But with no live sports to slake the public thirst, \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d likely will set some sort of ratings record for ESPN. In other words, Pistons fans still sensitive about the adulation slathered over the \u201990s Bulls at the expense of the Bad Boys should be prepared for an escalation in their blood pressure over the next month as the series plays out. The fact that sensitivity still lingers for those who lived it, now three decades on, speaks to the intensity of the rivalry that existed then \u2013 but also to the basis for those chafed feelings. ESPN.com, doing its part to hype interest in the documentary, ran a companion piece earlier this week that attempted to rank the dynasties in NBA history. The Bad Boys came in at No. 10 on the list for their run from 1987-91, which included five straight conference finals appearances, three straight NBA Finals and back-to-back titles. (The Goin\u2019 to Work Pistons, FYI, were first among the honorable mentions for their six-year run from 2003-08 that included six straight conference finals and one title among consecutive Finals appearances.) The Bulls were No. 2 behind the great Celtics dynasty that amassed 11 NBA titles from 1957-69. Chicago won six titles in an eight-year span, sandwiching three-peats around the two seasons Jordan spent riding buses while flailing at curveballs in baseball\u2019s minor leagues. The ESPN story explains its ratings formula \u2013 a combination of regular-season winning percentage and how far teams went in the playoffs, essentially \u2013 to give its rankings the veneer of statistical relevance and impartiality, but at its core it\u2019s way more art than science. What it isn\u2019t equipped to incorporate in its assessment are the obstacles in the paths of the championship teams. In order to get out of the East, the Pistons had to slay the Larry Bird-era Celtics. To win their first NBA title, they had to snuff out the Magic Johnson-led Lakers. Before doing either of those things, they had to hold off the Jordan-Scottie Pippen Bulls. Those are the fourth-, third- and second-ranked dynasties in ESPN\u2019s assessment. If none of those dynasties had existed in the most concentrated era of elite teams in NBA history, how many more titles would the Bad Boys have racked up? How many more consecutive NBA Finals appearances would they have made? Those Bulls that dominated the \u201990s didn\u2019t have to run the gauntlet the Bad Boys did. They would have been a great team in any era, but if a time machine would have allowed you to drop Jordan\u2019s Bulls into the middle of the \u201980s \u2013 with Bird\u2019s Celtics and Magic\u2019s Lakers dominant in each conference and the Bad Boys ascendant \u2013 they\u2019re not winning six titles. To paraphrase LeBron James, \u201cnot six \u2026 not five \u2026 not four \u2026 not three \u2026\u201d Or think of it the other way. If the Pistons timeline had come five years later \u2013 if they\u2019d started competing for titles in 1992 instead of 1987 \u2013 would they have six or two? Why the Bulls didn\u2019t face the same level of cutthroat competition for their six titles is open for debate. The influence of the salary cap coming into play in a meaningful way for the first time had a leveling effect on great teams. The teams that were closest to the Bulls in the \u201990s didn\u2019t have the mechanisms in place at the time to add the pieces they\u2019d have been able to get a decade earlier. The draft didn\u2019t produce many dominant individuals from the mid-\u201980s until Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 1992 after pumping out the likes of Bird, Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and Hakeem Olajuwon between 1979 and 1985. Sheer luck plays a bigger role in building champions than most care to acknowledge. At any rate, there\u2019s not much debate that the teams the Bulls had to beat to win their titles were no match for those the Pistons had to push aside or hold off to win theirs. Don\u2019t take my word for it. ESPN\u2019s own ranking of dynasties has no mention of any team other than the Bad Boys that the Bulls beat on their way to those titles \u2013 not the Knicks or Pacers or Cavs in the East, not the Jazz or Suns or Sonics in the West, none of which ever won a title. The dance partners the Pistons smartly built by Jack McCloskey and deftly coached by Chuck Daly encountered over their title-contention seasons were of the highest quality. The Pistons were dancing with the stars. The Bulls, on their last dance and through the \u201990s, were partnered with Sean Spicers. "}

But after several weeks adhering to stay-at-home guidelines issued by the state of Michigan, the Detroit Pistons director of merchandising and purchasing was also happy for opportunities to leave his St. Clair Shores home. Nothing against his wife and daughter. \u201cWorking from home has its pros and cons,\u201d Adam said earlier this week. \u201cI struggle working from home because I like being in the office so I looked at it as an opportunity to get out of the house and do something positive with that time to benefit the Pistons.\u201d Adam was part of a group of workers to unload 100,000 surgical masks purchased by Pistons owner Tom Gores. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem announced the donation at a Monday news conference where Duggan gave a progress report on the city\u2019s efforts to stop the highly infectious coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19. The masks will be provided to police officers, firefighters, bus drivers and other city workers serving the public in order to help slow the spread of the disease. \u201cFirst responders and city workers are on the front line of this crisis and they need our support now more than ever,\u201d Gores said in the release. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way people are coming together.\u201d The masks were purchased in New Jersey and a Pistons truck, driven by Adam, made the delivery to a city fire house near Eastern Market on Wednesday. Adam\u2019s first mission occurred last Thursday. Adam and Tom Lee, a facility manager, drove to the Cleveland Clinic, which donated 15,000 ICU surgical gowns to Henry Ford Health System, a Pistons corporate partner. Pistons vice president of event operations Chip Robinson got the ball rolling when he called Adam and told him about the opportunity. Following guidelines by wearing masks and gloves, Adam and Lee safely performed the act of charity. They shared driving duties in obtaining the load of 200-300 boxes; Lee drove to Cleveland, Adam drove back. \u201cWith the demand of the PPEs across all avenues of the healthcare industry, I just thought this was the perfect opportunity to volunteer and it was nice to be out of the house for a day,\u201d Adam said Henry Ford officials have applauded the many displays of support. In a question-answer session with Pistons guard Langston Galloway distributed on social media, Dr. Sara Hegab, a Henry Ford medical professional, recounted neighbors donating masks found in garages. \u201cThe amount of kindness I\u2019ve seen everywhere has been really amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been really inspiring. People are realizing we have to come together and we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Adam said such actions have come to be expected by the Pistons. He can easily recount other charitable efforts during his 32 years with the organization. During the crisis, the Pistons and business partners donated $375,000 to Forgotten Harvest, a non-profit addressing food insecurity. The Henry Ford-Detroit Pistons Performance Center has been made available for healthcare workers if the COVID-19 fight requires additional housing. The Pistons have also partnered with Detroit on a public service announcement encouraging people to stay home. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that the Pistons organization has always done is community initiatives (that) are extremely aggressive,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThis is not the first time that me or my team volunteered for any community program. \u201cWe value it and statements from owner Tom Gores on down that the Pistons are a community asset; I\u2019m a believer of that.\u201d  "}

Duggan was relieved to report progress and the city may avoid worst-case scenarios that could have overwhelmed the local healthcare system. But diligence is still required over the coming weeks.

July 4, 2000 \u2013 while the rest of America was off at picnics, parades and baseball games \u2013 seemed like the darkest day in Pistons franchise history. Grant Hill, 27 and a five-time All-Star, struck a free-agent deal with the Orlando Magic and \u2013 poof! \u2013 he was gone. It might not have induced the same level of bitter disappointment that losing Game 7 of the 1988 or 2005 Finals did, but it fostered an even worse emotion: despair. Even in the gloom of those Game 7 locker rooms, there was the certainty that the Bad Boys and the Goin\u2019 to Work Pistons would get their chance at redemption. There was no such certainty for the future of the 2000-01 Pistons and beyond with Hill \u2013 on whose shoulders so much was laden, labeled as Michael Jordan\u2019s heir when the Pistons drafted him in 1994 \u2013 gone in a flash. Instead, July 4, 2000 turned out to be the day the Pistons added the first building block of what would become an NBA championship team just four years later \u2013 a team that would win 50 or more games for seven consecutive seasons and play in six straight conference finals. Orlando had pointed to the summer of 2000 with grand designs of scoring an unprecedented free-agent coup, wooing not only Hill but Tracy McGrady and Tim Duncan, as well. Duncan eventually decided to remain in San Antonio \u2013 imagine the despair on the south central Texas plains if that hadn\u2019t played out \u2013 but the Magic got McGrady and weren\u2019t about to let Hill get out of town without agreeing to a maximum deal. Today\u2019s NBA contracts can be no more than five years in length if signing with the original team or four years if switching franchises. Back then, it was seven and six years. And the annual raises were larger, too \u2013 10 percent if signing with another team, 12.5 percent if with the original team. So the difference between getting a six- or a seven-year deal for Hill were significant \u2013 about $20 million over the life of the contract. But the only way for Hill to get the larger and longer deal was for the Magic to engage the Pistons in a sign and trade. Orlando originally balked; the Magic had the cap space to do the deal without the Pistons help. But when Hill and Lon Babby, the attorney he paid to negotiate his contract, threatened to move on to listen to Phoenix\u2019s pitch, Orlando management got on the phone with the Pistons. The Pistons asked for Ben Wallace to be a part of the return in trade. Wallace, then 25, had spent three years in Washington and one in Orlando after going undrafted in 1996 out of Virginia Union, and he\u2019d established himself as a high-energy role player. As Orlando\u2019s starting center in 1999-00, Wallace averaged 4.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 24 minutes a game. That\u2019s what the Pistons thought they were getting \u2013 a defensive plugger who could hold his own on the boards and grow with a young team in recovery mode after losing its superstar anchor. Orlando didn\u2019t want to give up Wallace, throwing out a few other names instead. But when the prize was Grant Hill \u2013 coming off arguably the greatest individual season in Pistons history with 25.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists a game \u2013 and the downside was seeing him sign with Phoenix, parting with an undrafted role player was about as painless as it gets in the superstar-acquisition business. Wallace averaged 13.2 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots a game in his first Pistons season, then led the NBA in both categories (13.0 and 3.5) in his second season. He would be named NBA Defensive Player of the Year four times and be named to the All-NBA teams five times over his first tour of duty with the Pistons. Hill, meanwhile, was beset by ankle injuries that began in his final brilliant season with the Pistons. Over his first four seasons with Orlando, Hill played in only 47 games. When the Pistons won the 2003-04 NBA championship \u2013 with Wallace playing 38 minutes a game over 81 games and earning second-team All-NBA honors \u2013 Hill didn\u2019t suit up for a single game. It was about as far-fetched an outcome as you could have conjured on that idyllic July 4 from four years earlier, when it seemed like a future of great possibility for the Pistons had evaporated. "}
{"team": "pistons", "url": "https://www.nba.com/pistons/chatmailbox/pistons-mailbag-april-15-2020", "date": "2020-04-15 00:00:00", "tags": ["Rose, Derrick", "Wood, Christian", "Pistons", "mailbag", "The Wrap"], "article": " After a month-long hiatus amid the coronavirus pandemic that forced the NBA to suspend its season on March 11, Pistons Mailbag makes its return with one huge caveat: The best answer to most questions these days \u2013 in sports and in life \u2013 is probably, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Ask me in a month.\u201d All things Pistons (@AllPistons): Bleacher Report predicted the Pistons to sign Harry Giles to a contract this off-season. What are your thoughts on this and how much money do you think he would command? Langlois: The biggest question mark with Giles is the status of his knees. Giles had three ACL tears \u2013 that\u2019s one more than most people have knees \u2013 before he got to the NBA. At one point, he was considered the No. 1 player in the high school class of 2016. He played just 300 minutes as a Duke freshman coming off of one of his knee injuries. He\u2019s been OK in his two years with Sacramento and he\u2019ll turn 22 this month. If the knees are stable, he\u2019s a guy who\u2019ll generate interest simply because NBA scouts have long memories and they know Giles was once considered a potential impact player. Even at the peak of his prospect status, Giles was a raw offensive prospect and not much has changed in that regard. But he\u2019s long and athletic and potentially an impact defender and active rebounder and rim runner. The Pistons, who have acknowledged they\u2019re in a rebuilding phase, should logically be interested in players who match Giles\u2019 profile. Whether that means they have faith in Giles\u2019 future durability is another matter. The fact Sacramento drafted Giles with the 20th pick says the Kings were sold on his potential two years ago; the fact the Kings didn\u2019t pick up his third-year option \u2013 the reason he\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent \u2013 says something else. I suspect there will be plenty of teams kicking the tires on Giles. Guessing how much a free agent will command on the open market is guesswork in normal circumstances. This off-season \u2013 whenever it commences \u2013 will be anything but normal. Delta Goose (@GooseDelta): Any shot at Christian Wood re-signing? Maybe getting too good to want to go through the rebuild? Money may be high to convince him to stay? Langlois: Any shot? Well, sure. You\u2019d have to give the Pistons the best odds of any team to keep Wood, but whether you\u2019d take the Pistons over the field is up for debate. The Pistons will be one of eight teams with more than the mid-level exception to offer. In fact, only Atlanta and New York will go into the off-season with more cap space than the Pistons, who were projected to have about $35 million in space \u2013 though that was based on a salary cap total that might be adjusted downward given the circumstances of the season\u2019s suspension. The Pistons could sign Wood for whatever they want out of their $35 million in space up to the league maximum. They could also see how the market develops for him, use their cap space on others \u2013 either by signing free agents or taking on contracts from other teams, quite likely incentivized by attached draft-pick compensation \u2013 and then sign Wood using the exception for early Bird free agents. That exception would permit the Pistons to sign Wood for 105 percent of the 2019-20 average NBA salary, which is projected to be something a shade over $10 million \u2013 which will be more than the mid-level exception. Unless one of the seven teams with cap space goes hard after Wood out of the gate, the Pistons should be in the thick of it for retaining him. Zay (@Sekou_SZN): What do you think the Pistons draft board will look like this year? Langlois: At the top, probably similar to that of other teams and what you\u2019re seeing on the few mock drafts or top 100 lists that have a semblance of credibility. There is less unanimity this season, it appears, than in most \u2013 owing to the lack of a consensus elite talent or two at the top of the draft. It\u2019s reminiscent of the 2013 draft in which Anthony Bennett wound up going No. 1 when there were more than a half-dozen players who seemed in the running at some point in the weeks leading to the draft. Michael Carter-Williams wound up as Rookie of the Year after being drafted 11th and has gone on to be a journeyman player. Bennett is out of the league. The best players from that draft turned out to be Giannis Antetokounmpo (drafted 15th), Victor Oladipo (second), C.J. McCollum (10th) and Rudy Gobert (27th). It would shock no one if the 2020 draft, seven years later, shows a similar arc. What the Pistons board looks like now, or will on draft night, whenever it happens to be, is anyone\u2019s guess. Bill Blasky (@bill_blasky): I would assume the Pistons are \u201cbest player available\u201d when they draft. They have so many holes to fill, although point guard seems to be the most glaring. Langlois: Of course. It\u2019s the only sane way to draft and that\u2019s especially true when a franchise has recently chosen to rebuild, as the Pistons have done and acknowledged. There are any number of reasons to adopt that philosophy. And if it was always so, it\u2019s even more true today in an era where positions matter as little as they ever have and skill trumps all. The only possible exception I would allow is if we\u2019re talking about centers. If you have a gifted and versatile center on your roster and one you anticipate being around for multiple seasons, then maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 you pass on a center at your draft slot if the next best pure talent is reasonably close in overall value. And I say that simply because it\u2019s tough to play two centers \u2013 honest-to-goodness big men without significant positional versatility \u2013 simultaneously. Two point guards? Yes. If I have vintage Chris Paul on my roster and at my draft slot vintage Derrick Rose is available, yes, I am taking Derrick Rose. I\u2019ll always have one of them on the floor and for 15 minutes or so a game I\u2019ll play them both at the same time and let the defense figure out how to respond. Two shooting guards? Yes, yes, yes. Especially if they can, you know, shoot. JayO (@JayO48409302): What can the Pistons do going forward next season with regard to free agents and the draft? Can we get an actual general manager or president of basketball operations (Chauncey Billups, for example)? Langlois: What they can do going forward is the same thing teams should do every off-season, no matter their stage of development: evaluate thoroughly and allocate resources \u2013 money, trade stock or draft choices \u2013 wisely. How that relates to the Pistons in their current state differs from teams that see themselves as within reach of title contention in that they should be willing to acquire players that perhaps don\u2019t fit long-term plans if the sweetener that comes with them \u2013 young players or draft picks \u2013 can accelerate their rebuilding. Billups is a smart guy and has in the past expressed interest in running a front office. Is he willing to serve in an apprentice role, a la ex-teammate Tayshaun Prince in Memphis, or is he determined to hold out until someone gives him a chief executive position? So far, he\u2019s held out for a No. 1 job and is doing A-OK for himself in TV. As for the Pistons, the focus on titles remains baffling. Ed Stefanski runs their front office and has for two years. He\u2019s had experience for more than 20 years in front offices in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Toronto and Memphis. No matter what you call him, Stefanski functions as a traditional general manager.

Smith never failed to entertain throughout his NBA career. And on this day in 2009, that was no exception, as the sharpshooter poured in 45 points and knocked down 11 3-pointers in a 118-98 Nuggets victory over the Sacramento Kings. As the Nuggets were closing in on a 54-28 campaign that would ultimately result in an appearance in the 2009 Western Conference Finals, Smith provided fans with a memorable performance at Pepsi Center. Smith, who still stands as the franchise leader in 3-pointers made with 768, really didn\u2019t catch fire until the second quarter, when he knocked down four 3-pointers on his way to a 14-point quarter. After scoring just three points in the third quarter, Smith exploded for 23 points on 5-of-10 shooting from the field in the fourth. As you probably guessed, all five of those made shots came from beyond the arc. Smith finished 11 of 18 from downtown, which is even more remarkable when you consider that the Nuggets finished 13 of 29 from deep as a team that night. Yes, you read that right. Smith accounted for 84.62 percent of the Denver\u2019s made three-pointers in the blowout victory. The 45 points still stand as a career-high for Smith, who carved out a nice career in the league as a sharpshooting, volume scorer. Nearly 40 percent of Smith\u2019s 971 career games came as a member of the Nuggets, with whom he averaged 13.7 points per game across five seasons. Smith also shot 38.2 percent from beyond the arc as a Nugget, which is slightly better than his career 37.3 percentage. The win over Sacramento gave Denver its 54th of the season, while Smith would go on to average 14.9 points per game across Denver\u2019s 16 playoff games that season. To relive Smith\u2019s explosive scoring performance, look no further than the video below. "}

In the interview, Kerr answered a wide range of questions from what prepared him to coach the Golden State Warriors, what he has spent his time and attention on during the shelter-in-place order, the advice he received that led to him coaching the Warriors, and more.  Take a look at some quotes from the 45-minute long interview below: On Michael Jordan\u2019s reputation for confronting teammates during practices? \u201cHe went after all of us\u2026 It wasn\u2019t always fun, for sure. But you kind of understood as it was happening this is serious stuff. This is the greatest player on Earth, and if you want to be able to compete with him, you got to stand up to him in practice, and that was part of the deal.\u201d On his identity as a head coach? \u201cI\u2019m definitely authentic to what I believe in, which is that there should be a joy to the game. It\u2019s one of the things I felt strongly about when I first coached the Warriors. I wanted to be fiercely competitive, but in doing so I wanted the players to feel a sense of joy when they walked into the building every day.\u201d On whether being a television analyst helped developed his coaching skills? \u201cI think there was a lot that came from the TV job. Part of the job which I really enjoyed was the sit down with the two coaches before the game\u2026 Sitting down at the time with Erik Spoelstra, Rick Carlisle, these guys who were just so accommodating and helpful. They were just giving information to help with our broadcast, but I was learning a ton from them, from all of the coaches in terms of what it\u2019s like to coach in the league and what they\u2019re looking for.

{"team": "nuggets", "url": "https://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/nuggets-roundtable-player-development-041520", "date": "2020-04-15 00:00:00", "tags": ["Bol, Bol", "Harris, Gary", "Morris, Monte", "Murray, Jamal", "Porter Jr., Michael"], "article": " The Denver Nuggets currently sit in a rare position in the NBA, as the team is a top-three seed in the Western Conference that relies mostly on players under the age of 26 to fuel their recent success. As a result of impressive draft picks over the past five seasons and even more impressive results developing those players, the Nuggets are poised to remain a contender in the Western Conference for years to come. In this Nuggets.com roundtable, Nuggets.com writers Eric Spyropoulos and Alex Labidou discuss some of the key questions related to Denver\u2019s player development program and the results that the team has seen in recent seasons. Spyropoulos: The most impressive aspect of the player development in recent seasons has just been the number of players the Nuggets have drafted and actually developed into rotation caliber players. Nikola [Joki\u0107] and Jamal [Murray], who the Nuggets drafted, are the team\u2019s leading duo. Then you have Gary Harris, Monte Morris, who are staples of the rotation. You also had Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez and Malik Beasley, who were also part of the rotation before being traded. Labidou: That\u2019s a good point. I can\u2019t, off the top of my head, point to another team in the NBA who have as many drafted rotation players as the Nuggets have had in the past two or three seasons. You look at the LA teams for example, and their rosters are largely constructed by free agency. It\u2019s fun to see what the Nuggets are doing. I think the biggest area where it helps Denver is the buy in. Most of these guys have been drafted by the team. I think for Coach [Michael] Malone, it is easier to teach a philosophy or system to a player who has been drafted or brought in at a young age to the team. Spyropoulos: Yeah, I think it will help in the future too, seeing how the model has worked. Sometimes, you might not play as much as you would want in your rookie season. Given the success that Denver has had in the past with player development, those rookies or new players can see a path toward their future. They can see how loyal and dedicated the team has been in player development. Labidou: What is fascinating to me is the parallels between what Denver is doing now and what the Spurs did during their time as contenders. I think the Nuggets understand their place in relation to other NBA markets and how player development has to be a crucial part of it. Spyropoulos: Despite some challenges, I think overall they\u2019ve done as good of a job as you\u2019d expect them to. Monte, in his rookie season, played over 30 G League games. He\u2019s now developed into one of the best backup point guards in the NBA over the last two seasons. Torrey Craig, although he was 26 or 27 in his rookie season, he played 15 games in the G League on a two-way contract. He\u2019s been a pretty big addition for the team over the last two seasons. Malik Beasley played in the G League a lot in his rookie season. In his second year, he started showing why he can be a fit in the NBA and thrived over the past two seasons. That rookie season really gave him a chance to grow. Labidou: As you mentioned earlier, young players are likely going to follow suit if they see their colleagues having to do that as well, especially in situations like Beasley and Morris. And I think the product of this season\u2019s trips to the G League will pay dividends in the coming seasons. We didn\u2019t get to see Bol Bol play in the NBA this season, but he showed some promising signs in the development this year. Vlatko \u010can\u010dar struggled early on in the G League, but really developed some confidence towards the end of his stay. Jarred Vanderbilt, before he got traded, had shown some marked improvement. READ MORE: Bol Bol Film Study Then there is PJ Dozier, who really blossomed and literally played four positions at the Windy City Bulls. I believe he was in the conversation for G League MVP and he really established that he is an NBA player both during his time in the G League and NBA. So just seeing his development has been encouraging and he\u2019s really proven that he can carve a niche for himself on the Nuggets. The G League played a big part in that. Spyropoulos: Yeah, I think the last thing I'll say is and this is kind of about the third question too, but the fact that there are so many people like Nuggets fans and some analysts look at, you know, guys like PJ and Vlatko and they're already projecting that this could be the \u201cnext Monte\u201d for the Nuggets. With how much success that the Nuggets have already had with two-way contracts and player development, the fact that pretty much anytime someone gets on a two-way or is drafted by the Nuggets, the fans and the analysts already kind of project them to be a rotation player in two years. That really speaks to how good the system has been. Spyropoulos: It's kind of tough because, at some point, their current players are going to reach the age where it's \u201cwin-now\u201d time. I don't think Denver's at that point yet. But there may be a time where they start trading young players and future draft picks for an established All-Star or something like that, which makes it a little bit difficult to project the future. But I think the basic key to this question is just continuing to draft well. If they (the Nuggets) just draft well, I feel pretty confident in the player development program that if they get a player in the system, that player is going to develop into at least a rotation caliber player. But the fact is you have to have the draft picks. Labidou: I think if you speak to most people around the Nuggets organization, losing Malik and Juancho was a difficult decision, but I think they saw the writing on the wall of sort of where this team is and sort of improving that pipeline that has done the team so well over the past, you know, three to four years. So I think, for them, they realized that the odds of keeping both and making both happy and also keeping player development as part of the philosophy would have been very hard to hit all three of those things. And that's why you needed to make that trade. And, to your point, again, you know, it's kind of a luxury where you look at the draft picks and you're confident that these are well-made decisions that aren't just you know, someone throwing a dart at the wall. It's these are really well-calculated decisions and that that's a credit to the organization scouting and analytics department who do a heck of a job. Spyropoulos: Yeah, that is the case for the Nuggets, they kind of have that luxury like you said that if they do have draft picks, or even trading into the draft like how they got Bol, which is, you know, another philosophy that the Nuggets have taken recently is taking a little bit more risk with their draft picks like Michael Porter Jr. and Bol Bol, but even their safer picks they've nailed on and that's kind of a luxury to have as they continue to try and get more into win-now mode. But at the same time, if they have one or two draft picks each draft you have you feel confident that they're going to continue to replenish at least the backups in the rotation which is huge for a contending team. Once you hit on enough of those kinds of steady, surefire picks, you know, the desire and willingness to take a risk on a Michael Porter or Bol Bol is, especially once you get in the second round, which is what kind of threw me off about so many teams last year is that they just let Bol slide when most of the second-rounders don't even make the NBA. So why not take a shot on a guy who either may never make the NBA or if he does could be one of the most unique players of all time? Labidou: Yeah, I think with Bol especially in the second round, especially as far as he fell, it was a no-brainer decision. You get a player who, for the past two years had been called a lock for the lottery at minimal risk. "}

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. In the fall of 1997, filmmaker Jason Hehir was granted unprecedented access to the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls as he documented the team\u2019s quest for a sixth NBA Championship in eight years. Two decades later, basketball fans will have the chance to go behind the scenes to watch Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and even Dubs\u2019 Head Coach Steve Kerr (then a reserve on the team) compete through the season amid internal tensions.  The team agreed to let Hehir and his film crew follow them all season long, even into the locker room and team practices, as Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their quest to win one last title as a group before many of of their contracts ended. Basketball fans will now have the opportunity to see the intensity Jordan brought to games and practices, as well as watch never-before-seen footage of one of basketball\u2019s great dynasties. The first two episodes will premiere on ESPN this coming Sunday, April 19th, at 6:00 p.m. Two more episodes will debut each Sunday thereafter.  Can't wait for Sunday? Neither can we.So we're dropping five minutes from the first episode of #TheLastDance pic.twitter.com/qW0Z3rmSxr Kerr took part in a phone conference earlier this week to discuss the upcoming release and recall some of what happened that season. Take a look at some select parts from that call below: What do you think Michael Jordan\u2019s sort of candor will mean to the general public, and what sort of level of candor did you see from him as a teammate? STEVE KERR: I'm excited for this movie because I think there's a whole generation of young basketball players and fans who have only heard about Michael and who didn't really experience his dominance, and so to really see it up close, to see the impact he had on the game, to see not only the physical but the mental and the emotional dominance he carried with him on the court every single game I think will be really interesting and enlightening for an entire generation of young fans. What was it like with the camera crews around all the time during that season, and what was sort of the team's collective reaction to granting that kind of access? KERR: Yeah, it was definitely strange at the time. That was not an era where there was a ton of access behind the scenes. And for Phil Jackson, the locker room and the team's space was always very sacred, so it was kind of a surprise at the time when we were alerted to what was happening. But I think everybody embraced it pretty quickly because we were well aware we were playing in a very historic era and playing for a historic team. And so I think we all understood that someday this would all be captured and it would be great for us to see it and remember it and show our kids and grandkids. 20-plus years later there's always a feel-good vibe in Chicago to the championship run and all that went with it, but heading into that '97-' 98 season before the sixth title run, what do you recall about that lingering tension between the front office, coaches, and players? KERR: Well, it definitely felt like the last season. It wasn't something that was concocted by (Head Coach) Phil (Jackson) when he called it the last dance. It was real. Everybody's contracts were up, basically had an entire team full of free agents, and it just felt like that was going to be it. And so we wanted to make the most of the moment.

Extraordinary at the top, the 2020 Hall class is nevertheless incomplete. It joins all the other draft classes that exclude Jack McCloskey, the architect of the Bad Boys. Not only did McCloskey acquire every single building block of the 1989 and \u201990 championship Pistons, masterfully working the draft and trade avenues in the era that preceded meaningful free agency, he drafted the man who succeeded him and built the 2004 championship team, Joe Dumars. McCloskey died in June 2017 at 91 after suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s.

The Dubs had an opportunity to sweep the NBA Finals in Game 4 and finish the playoffs undefeated, but the Cleveland Cavaliers made a stand on their home court with a three-point barrage and forced the series to Game 5. This was the Warriors chance to now close out the series on Warriors Ground. The squad had already made history in the 2017 playoffs by setting an NBA record 15 straight postseason victories, eclipsing the Los Angeles Lakers of 1988 and 1989 record of 13 consecutive wins. Kevin Durant was dropping over 30 points each game and Stephen Curry was averaging a near-triple-double with 25 points, 8.5 rebounds and 9.3 assists. But in a familiar situation up 3-1 in the NBA Finals, would the team conquer their demons from the season before? Things took an uncomfortable turn early as the Warriors came out of the first quarter trailing the Cavaliers 37-33. Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James then added on four more points to open the second quarter.

Also adding key buckets in that span were David West, who started the run by making a jumper and layup, and Andre Iguodala who added a thunderous dunk after Kyrie Irving was stripped of the ball on the other end of the floor.  .@andre brings the boom! (ABC) #NBAFinals #StrengthInNumbers #DubNation pic.twitter.com/0cFaoNN3cn That burst proved to be critical for the Dubs too. Over a four minute span of the third quarter, Cleveland held the Dubs to just two points while adding 11 points of their own, reducing the Warriors lead to 84-77. The Cavaliers made another push in the beginning of the fourth quarter to bring the game to a 98-95 Dubs\u2019 lead. The Warriors were battling the full force of Cleveland\u2019s resiliency. But the Warriors never gave up the lead they generated with their second quarter run.

It was a highly anticipated rematch as the Warriors, who defeated Cleveland in 2015 for the NBA Championship, were upset by the Cavaliers after the Warriors held a 3-1 series lead in 2016.

Stephen Curry was electric on Feb. 4, 2015 in the Dubs\u2019 128-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks. But those numbers don\u2019t even tell the whole story. Yes, they are impressive, but Curry hit a whole other gear that Wednesday night in the third quarter when he posted 26 points in the one frame alone.  Curry played all 12 minutes of the third quarter against the Mavericks. He went a near-perfect 6-of-7 from beyond the arc to go with 4-of-5 from the free throw line. The electric shooting display had Dub Nation on Warriors Ground chanting M-V-P every chance they could get, and the 51-point total would be Curry\u2019s second-highest scoring performance of his career (54 at New York on February 27, 2013) at that point. Ironically, the Dubs got off to a slow start in the game too. It took over three minutes and five missed shots before an Andrew Bogut putback finally put the team on the board. But the Mavericks would soon rally off 14 straight points and the Warriors faced their largest deficit of the game at 40-18 with 1:23 left in the first quarter. Although the Warriors were down, they weren\u2019t out. They got back into the game thanks to some quality perimeter marksmanship from Splash Brothers Curry and Klay Thompson, and Leandro Barbosa as well. The trio combined for seven first half 3-pointers to bring Dubs to a 62-58 deficit at the half. When the Warriors returned from the halftime break, that\u2019s when Curry got hot. His hot shooting fueled the Warriors outscoring Dallas 110-74 after the 22-point deficit in the first quarter. The victory was the 39th of the season for the Warriors, who had the best record in the NBA at that point and would go on to finish with a league-best 67-15 mark on their way to winning the title that season.

The Dubs\u2019 21-point win in Game 4 of the 2015 NBA Finals was followed up with a Game 5 win back on Warriors Ground.

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. Five years ago today, Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr made history. A Dubs\u2019 123-110 victory over the Dallas Mavericks secured his place in NBA history with the all-time record for most wins by a first-year head coach. The win on that Saturday night was the 63rd for Kerr and the Warriors, who would go on to finish the regular season with a 67-15 record. That accomplishment was the first of many as a head coach for Kerr, who has on numerous occasions credited former Warriors Head Coach Mark Jackson with creating a winning attitude within the organization and spoke how he was so lucky to inherit a team with so much talent. \"He set the table for a lot of what's happening now. He deserves a lot credit,\u201d said Kerr in 2015. \u201cWhen I was in TV, I was doing Warriors games for years; every year, they were one of the worst defensive teams in the league. Mark came in and made a focus of being a tough defensive-minded team\u2026 We already knew they had established that defensive identity. Our job was to improve the offense \u2014 to get more movement and more flow. And that was my focus.\u201d Even with that modesty, one can\u2019t ignore the team\u2019s success while Kerr has manned the sidelines. He coached the 2014-15 Warriors\u2019 to their first NBA Championship in 40 years, led the team to the NBA Finals the following four consecutive seasons and won two more titles in 2017 and 2018, and in the process became the fastest coach in any major sport to reach the 300-win plateau, needing 377 games to do so. He was also selected as an assistant coach to the USA Basketball Men's National Team by legendary head coach Gregg Popovich. Unfortunately, Kerr\u2019s sixth season has played out far differently from what was expected. Injuries to Klay Thompson (ACL) and Stephen Curry (hand), as well as more bumps and bruises to other Dubs throughout the campaign, took their toll. The roster has gone through a variety of changes as the Warriors made several moves, including trades, maneuvering around two-player contract limitations and bringing on new Dubs with 10-day contracts. With an ever-changing squad through most of the season, Kerr\u2019s 2019-20 Warriors own the worst record in the NBA at 15-50. One would think this sudden downturn would affect Kerr negatively, but that has not been the case. After shootaround on Jan. 10, Kerr told media \u201cI still enjoy coming to work every day, working with the players, working with the staff and management.\u201d  A culture built on joy.|| @SteveKerr pic.twitter.com/AjVwpdeUVM \u201cWe have a great group of people here,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDespite the losses, I\u2019m still having fun. I think everybody is.\u201d The fun comes in the form of a new challenge this season for the Warriors\u2019 head coach. In his first five seasons, Kerr was able to lean on the talents and synergy of Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and additional veterans who joined the team at various times, including two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, former All-Star David West and longtime pros Shaun Livingston and Zaza Pachulia. By his own admission, previous seasons were more about \u201c[managing] the team though the season, prepare for the playoffs, and try to get guys rest when I could.\u201d But the 2019-20 season is different, and not just because of the team\u2019s record. \u201cWe just have to adapt as a coach and adapt to your circumstances and continue to work\u2026. We had to focus more on details with these young guys than we\u2019ve had to in the last five years,\u201d Kerr said in early March. \u201cI feel our staff has done a great job,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe players are developing, but we are losing and the name of the game is to win. We are hoping that this season, at least, is a productive one in terms of getting us ready for what is coming down the road.\u201d The younger Dubs on the squad are responding to Kerr\u2019s plan for development, too. Warriors big man Marquese Chriss praised his head coach on Mar. 7, saying \u201cSteve (Kerr) is a player\u2019s coach. He lets you play, lets you hoop and play through your mistakes. I think that is the biggest thing for us is to be able to play through our mistakes and build from there.\u201d  \u201cThis is a championship organization. They know what they want and they know what it takes. I think that we all came here with open minds and are willing to learn,\u201d he finished. One of those who Kerr granted the opportunity to play though early growing pains in their young career is rookie Jordan Poole. Through his first 29 games, Poole averaged 7.1 points on 25.4 percent shooting. But prior to the NBA season being put on hold due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Poole had scored in double digits 12 of his last 13 games, averaging 14.3 points on 47.2 percent from the floor in that span. The credit, he said, was due to Kerr and the relationship he established with Poole. \u201cBeing able just to have your head coach, even if you\u2019re going through a struggle, or you know you\u2019re not playing up to your potential, and continue to have a coach who wants to push you, push you, push you, and knows what your limits are and he knows your strengths, and I\u2019m kind of just beyond blessed to be in this situation,\u201d said Poole on Mar. 1.  A playoff appearance is not in the cards for the Warriors given their record, snapping their streak of consecutive postseason appearances at seven. The team has pivoted to giving players opportunities to put their talents on display as they prepare for next season. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Kerr hasn\u2019t had any positive takeaways from the 2019-20 campaign.

I haven\u2019t had to coach a situation like this, and it\u2019s been a good reminder that every circumstance is different, every year is different.\u201d Share Links: You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. \u201cThe phrase you thought you would not hear in your lifetime: the Golden State Warriors are going to the NBA Finals.\u201d Warriors radio broadcaster Tim Roye voiced those words on Wednesday, May 27, 2015, as the Dubs beat the Rockets 104-90 to win the Western Conference Finals in five games, stamping the Dubs\u2019 first ticket to the NBA Finals since the 1975 Championship season. It was a big win for the team, but not one that came easily. Going against a Houston squad led by James Harden, Dwight Howard, and Trevor Ariza meant the Warriors would need a team effort to pull out a victory. That is exactly what happened that night.  Both teams came out of the gate struggling: the Dubs shot 22 percent from the floor with six turnovers, while the Rockets didn\u2019t fare much better at 30 percent and seven turnovers. But the slump would not last long for the Warriors. The second quarter opened with Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, and Andre Iguodala hitting five of the Dubs\u2019 first seven shots to go on a 13-2 run in the first three-and-a-half minutes to reclaim a 30-24 lead. That was a lead the Warriors didn\u2019t relinquish to the Rockets for the duration of the game. Houston did not let the game get out of hand though as they kept the deficit in the single digits for a majority of the second and third quarters, thereby keeping the pressure on the Dubs. But the teamwork demonstrated in the second quarter continued at the opening of the fourth when the Warriors\u2019 supporting cast, rather than their headliners, put the game away. Festus Ezeli, Andre Iguodala and Harrison Barnes combined to score the Warriors\u2019 first 21 points of the fourth frame. Their combined effort sent the Dubs ahead by as much as 15 points early in the fourth to guarantee the victory in Oakland in front of Dub Nation.  The Dubs\u2019 win in the 2015 Western Conference Finals marked a turning point for the franchise as it was the first of five consecutive seasons the team would take the Western Conference crown and head to the NBA Finals. The squad would go on to win the title that season, and twice more in 2017 and 2018 in that run.

Warriors Classics: 2015 NBA Finals - Game 1Warriors vs. Cavaliers - 6/4/15 \t  Re-Air: 8 p.m. tonight on NBC Sports Bay Area     -->  The Warriors\u2019 40-year NBA Finals drought, the longest time between Finals appearances in NBA history, came to an end on June 4, 2015, when the Dubs hosted the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first game of what would turn out to be four straight NBA Finals matchups between the two clubs. And what a return it was, as Game 1 of the NBA Finals earned instant classic status with the Warriors earning a 108-100 win in overtime. Warriors radio broadcaster Tim Roye relives that game in the Warriors Sound Flashback below (at the 9:25 mark), but not before we catch up with NBC Sports Bay Area Warriors sideline reporter Kerith Burke, who reflects on her experiences on the job so far. Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals will be remembered for several reasons. A back-and-forth affair that featured 13 lead changes and 11 ties before the Warriors took the lead for good with a 10-0 run to open overtime, the game was within four points for the final 19 minutes and 22 seconds of regulation, and right up until a Harrison Barnes 3-pointer, the Dubs only field goal in the extra period, three minutes into overtime. Marreese Speights had some big baskets off the bench, Andre Iguodala ended multiple quarters with buzzer-beating dunks and Stephen Curry scored four of his team-high 26 points in the extra period, all via free throws. Put it all together, it was just enough to beat a Cavs team that got what was then an NBA Finals career-high 44 points from LeBron James, and 23 from Kyrie Irving, who exited the game with a knee injury suffered just prior to the Barnes\u2019 3-pointer.  The Warriors would go on to win the 2015 NBA Finals in six games, marking this first of three titles in four seasons, but there\u2019s no doubt that this first game of this first Finals run in 40 years will go down as a pivotal moment in Dubs history.

The Currys\u2019 Eat. Learn. Play foundation have teamed up with the Alameda County Community Food Bank and the Oakland Unified School District to fight food insecurity and ensure all children who rely on their school system for food will receive at least two meals a day. Curry and his wife, Ayesha, have called on others to join their pledge to provide more than one million meals to Bay Area children in need. Oakland just announced they're closing schools until April because of the COVID-19 crisis. While we support this decision, we're concerned about what this means for childhood hunger in our hometown. More than 18,000 students in Oakland rely on their school for 2+ meals each day and our foundation @eatlearnplay is making a donation to @accfb and @feedingamerica to help ensure no child has to worry about where their next meal is coming from while schools are closed. Please join us by donating to @ACCFB or a food bank near you. Link in bio A post shared by  Wardell Curry (@stephencurry30) on Mar 13, 2020 at 7:52pm PDT Days later, Curry actively educated the public on the realities of COVID-19 through an informative Q+A with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In the discussion, the esteemed doctor explained the importance of taking adequate measures to protect ourselves and others from this highly contagious virus.  Thank you to everyone who tuned in earlier today on Instagram Live! I wanted to make sure everyone had access to the conversation on COVID-19 with Dr. Fauci. Please share as much as possible. Thank you! #SCASKSFAUCI https://t.co/CtLGPy6Neg Curry also watched some Warriors basketball, reliving the night fellow Splash Brother, Klay Thompson, dropped 60 points in three quarters in a NBC Sports Bay Area re-air of the Warriors classic.  Just watched @KlayThompson drop 60 in 3 Q\u2019s. I legit was watching it like it was live. For 48 min my soul smiled! That boy good. And of course, Curry wouldn\u2019t be Curry without a little friendly competition. As a form of distraction, the three-time NBA champion shared how he\u2019s been playing through his time at home, including a perfect hole in one.

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. The Warriors were on a roll through the 2017 NBA Playoffs. They had not lost a game through the first three rounds and the Dubs took Game 1 of the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers at home in Oakland. But on June 4, 2017 when the Dubs hosted Game 2, few could have predicted the on-court fireworks that were to come. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry led the charge of a high-scoring shoot out with 33 and 32 points respectively, leading the Dubs to a 132-113 victory. Durant added 13 rebounds, six assists, three steals, and five blocks, thereby becoming just the fourth player in NBA Finals history to register at least 30 points and five blocks in a game. Curry\u2019s 32 came with 10 rebounds and 11 assists for a triple-double.  But their Dubs\u2019 65-combined-point night drove Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James to come out with his own spectacular performance as he finished with his own triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 14 assists. The electricity on the court created a duel for the ages as three MVPs battled it out in a high-scoring affair in front of Dub Nation. #StephGonnaSteph on ABC. #NBAFinals A post shared by  Golden State Warriors (@warriors) on Jun 4, 2017 at 6:48pm PDT Curry and James entered a unique portion of the history books as well, marking just the second time in Playoff history opposing players had triple-doubles. But having players like them show up at at time like this in the NBA Finals came as no surprise to Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr. \u201cThe talent on the floor in this series is just unbelievable. Obviously with Steph and KD and Klay and Draymond, but trying to stop LeBron and Kyrie, Kevin Love was tremendous tonight. It really is a series that's just loaded with high-powered weapons all over the floor.\u201d The Dubs took their 2-0 series lead into Cleveland for the following two games, ultimately taking their first loss of the 2017 NBA Playoffs in Game 4. The Finals returned to Oakland for Game 5, where the Warriors would claim the championship for their second of three championships in a four-year span. Steve Kerr \u201cWell, it's been a great run, but none of that matters unless we can finish the job with this series. We know, trust me, we know. It was 2-0 last year and we lost. So playing an unbelievably good, competitive team, dominant team. They have, what, two, three losses the whole Playoffs. Now we got to go back there. This is where the series changed last year, so we're just trying to think about the next game.\u201d Stephen Curry \u201cObviously did a lot of other great things and tried to impact the game across the board, other than just scoring and a total team effort tonight with how we played and withstood their first punch coming out of the first quarter.\u201d On his possession and dribble sequence against LeBron James in the third quarter: \u201cIt's basketball, man, I mean, every possession have the opportunity to impact the game, doesn't matter who really is across from you, you don't get into the one-on-one matchups, especially on this stage because you get distracted from how you're supposed to be playing. Obviously he's a great defender, so if you have opportunities, you know you have to do something pretty special to score. But for the most part, you can't focus on like you're on the playground, it's just y'all two out there, that doesn't do you any good in those situations.\u201d Kevin Durant \u201cLike I said, we're worried about the series right now. So we're just trying to just stay in the moment. But for the most part we just try to play hard and try to play smart every possession down. Can we do that? We could play hard every possession, but can we play smart? That's the question sometimes. And so we're just trying to stay with it. We know this is far from over. We know how hard it is to be the best team in the league. So we got to just keep going, man, keep our foot on the gas and keep getting better every day.\" You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. Warriors guard Stephen Curry has had no shortage of iconic moments and performances throughout his decorated career, and somewhere near the top of the list of his most memorable shots was one that occurred in the final seconds of regulation of Game 3 of the Warriors\u2019 first round playoff series against the New Orleans Pelicans. The situation: The Warriors won the first two games of the series at home but faced an uphill battle in New Orleans in Game 3 when they entered the fourth quarter down by 20 points. The Warriors chipped away at that deficit throughout the quarter, and after New Orleans star Anthony Davis split a pair of free throws with 9.6 seconds left to give the Pelicans a three-point lead, the window was left slightly ajar for the Warriors to make their move. Curry\u2019s first attempt to tie the game with a three-pointer was off the mark, but teammate Marreese Speights pulled down the rebound and dished it back to Curry in the left corner. Curry caught the pass, and with multiple Pelicans defenders, including the 6-foot-10 Davis and his lengthy wingspan, charging toward him, Curry launched the shot and \u2026 swish!!! Game tied, 2.8 seconds left. New Orleans\u2019 Tyreke Evans launched a running 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it was off the mark and the game was destined for overtime.  Steph Curry sent the game to OT with this CLUTCH three. #SPLASH #StephGonnaSteph pic.twitter.com/RUiz88eXos Curry\u2019s game-tying shot, his second 3-pointer in the final 12 seconds of regulation, capped a 10-point quarter and 40-point night, but he was just one part of the Dubs\u2019 offensive explosion through the fourth. Shaun Livingston (nine points) and Leandro Barbosa (six) combined for 15 points off of the bench in the period. Starters Klay Thompson (five), Draymond Green (five) and Harrison Barnes (four) all added to the swing in momentum, as the Warriors outscored New Orleans 39-19 in the fourth quarter. The game would remain close through the extra period, but the Warriors came out on top with a 123-119 victory, and complete the sweep of the Pelicans two nights later to move on to the Western Conference Semifinals.  When reflecting on the game recently with beat writer Wes Goldberg, Kerr said that \u201cthat first round was a big step for us.\u201d \u201cThere was no reason why we had to look at that season as a stepping stone to a future title. We were trying to convince them that \u2018Hey, this is now. We can do this right now,\u2019\u201d Kerr told the team then. And that they did. After the Pelicans, the Warriors would go on to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies and Houston Rockets en route to the NBA Finals. There, the squad would meet and eventually beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2 to claim the franchise\u2019s first NBA title in 40 years.

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times.  The number 37 will forever be synonymous with Klay Thompson. That\u2019s because on Jan. 23, 2015, the Warriors guard set an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third period of a 126-101 win over the Sacramento Kings at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Warriors Classics: Klay\u2019s 37-Point Quarter \t  Warriors vs. Kings - 1/23/15 \t  Re-Air: 8 p.m. Tonight on NBC Sports Bay Area      ---> After going 3-for-9 from the floor, and 2-for-5 on 3-pointers, in the first half, Thompson, the 24-year-old guard who was three weeks shy of playing in his first All-Star Game, sent the home crowd into a frenzy with a legendary performance. The scoring binge started over two minutes into the third period, when he drove from the right wing to the left side of the key, spinning into a 12-foot jumper that put the Dubs ahead 60-58. The fourth-year pro registered a steal about a minute later, igniting a fast break that he finished with a pull-up 3-pointer. And from that point on, Thompson absolutely owned the quarter. Relive the incredible effort in the Warriors Sound Flashback below: Thompson\u2019s 37 points in the quarter came on a perfect 13-for-13 from the field, including 9-for-9 on 3-pointers. Those nine 3-pointers in a quarter were an NBA record that still stands, and the 13 field goals tied a league record. \u201cI was just trying to shoot until I miss,\u201d Thompson told Warriors radio broadcaster Tim Roye after the game. \u201cHonestly, I took like four heat checks, but they just kept going in.\u201d  Thompson scored 37 of the Warriors\u2019 41 points in the quarter, while the Kings were held to 22 over that stretch. Over the final 3:03 of the quarter, Thompson out-scored Sacramento 18-3. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. I just got into a zone and it was the best zone I\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d he said. Less than a week after this out-of-this-world performance, Thompson, who finished the night with what was then a career-high 52 points despite sitting out the last nine and a half minutes of the game, would be named an All-Star for the first time in his career.  Klay Thompson \u201cIt\u2019s pretty surreal, and really you just feel like every shot you throw \u2013 it\u2019s the clich\u00e9 that every shot you\u2019re going to throw up is going to go in. That\u2019s how it felt. I think that\u2019s why I got up 13 shots in the third quarter, just because I was taking a lot of bad shots out there, but I was taking one until I missed, and just got lucky.\u201d On if he's ever had a scoring night like that before: \u201cI had like 50, playing down. I was in fourth grade; I was playing with some third graders too. That is honestly the last time I went on a scoring barrage like that.\u201d Steve Kerr \"I was one of the luckiest NBA players to play with Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, David Robinson and some of greatest players ever. As many spectacular things as Michael did, which he did nightly, I never saw him do that.\" \"After he made about seven or eight in a row I was just watching his face to see what I could see. I\u2019ve never seen anyone that zoned in. Just spectacular to watch.\" Stephen Curry \"I\u2019ve never seen a shooting display that consistent of just searching for a shot and knocking it down. To go 9-for-9 in a quarter from the three- point line is still unbelievable. I thought I would never see that. Unbelievable.\" \"They knew at some point that all we were doing was dribbling around trying to get him the ball. It was like Will Smith in Fresh Prince, just dribble around and give him the ball. They still couldn\u2019t get there fast enough when he released it. It was beautiful.\" You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

That\u2019s why I am really looking forward to tonight\u2019s replay of two great games in Warriors history on 95.7 The Game, one that saw a great comeback in the Western Conference Finals and the other with one of the most bizarre plays in NBA Finals history. The first will be Game 7 of the 2018 Western Conference Finals which will be followed by Game 1 of the 2018 Finals with yours truly and Jim Barnett on the call. 2018 Western Conference FinalsGame 7: Warriors at Rockets \t  2018 NBA FInalsGame 1: Warriors vs. Cavaliers \t  Re-Airs Begin at 6 p.m. on 95.7 The Game  --> The Warriors almost didn\u2019t make Game 7 of the WCF as they trailed the Rockets 3-2 and were down 17 points in Game 6, but behind nine 3-point buckets from Klay Thompson, they had scratched out a Game 6 win at Oracle. There was a quiet confidence around the team though and it was apparent in how they handled themselves at shootaround and before Game 7. Following a pattern in this series, Golden State trailed early, down by 15 at one point and it was Houston leading 54-43 at halftime. The Rockets seemed to tire in the second half in this series. That pattern, by the way, is one that the 1974-75 championship Warriors had followed as well. As the Warriors regained their footing, the Rockets would miss 27 straight threes and would finish 1 of their last 30 attempts. The Warriors won 101-92 overcoming the largest deficit that a road team had ever faced at halftime of a Game7. In the second half of Game 6 and Game 7, the Warriors outscored the rockets 122-63! With that win, the Warriors advanced to its fourth-consecutive NBA Finals and were the fifth franchise in NBA history to reach the Finals in four-straight seasons, joining the Boston Celtics (10, 1957-1966; 4 1984-87), Cleveland Cavaliers (4, 2015-18), Los Angeles Lakers (4, 1982-1985) and Miami Heat (4, 2011-2014). It was also the first time in American Sports history that two teams had met in any Finals for four straight years. Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals had one of the most bizarre plays I have ever seen. The Warriors led by one after a Curry three, 107-106  with just 23.5 seconds remaining. Gorge Hill got fouled and made the first free throw to tie it but missed the second which was rebounded by JR Smith. Smith forgot what the score was and dribbled the ball to mid-court where LeBron James gestured wildly. By the time he had realized it and passed to Hill on the wing, whose wild attempt at the buzzer was blocked. All I remember about the break between regulation and overtime was seeing the shock and relief on the faces of the fans. I thought that there was no way that Cleveland could rebound from the way regulation ended and the Warriors ended up with the first nine points in OT en route to the win. Thanks to our friends at 95.7 the Game, we can relive these two great games in Warriors beginning tonight, Friday March 20th, at 6 p.m. You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times. On September 30th during his Media Day press conference, eight-year veteran Draymond Green said taking a leadership role along with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson would be a change from prior years: \u201cIt'll definitely be different. We've got a lot of new blood\u2026 But I think that's fine. You know, you get a chance to know these young guys, mentor them, kind of show them the way.\u201d Though playing with 17 first-year Warriors throughout the season (through March 10) may have seemed like a daunting task, Green quickly followed that up with \u201cI'm excited about it,\u201d ready to accept a new type of leadership role. One of the first Warriors to experience the schooling of Green was rookie forward Eric Paschall. At a practice on October 19 following the Warriors\u2019 preseason games, Paschall spoke positively of his early experiences. \u201cI feel like Steph (Curry) and Draymond (Green) just talk to us so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, Dray, every little play out there when he was sitting out, he\u2019s taught me so much that I can get better at, even on the floor just recognizing and seeing the next play before it even happens.\u201d Fast forward over five months, and one could say the season has not gone as hoped. The Dubs have been marred with a variety of injuries and have gone through a number of roster changes throughout their 2019-20 campaign. For Green, this meant getting accustomed to constant changes on the court and learning about new teammates as they joined the Warriors. Through the NBA\u2019s stoppage of play due to the spread of COVID-19, the Warriors have used 33 unique starting lineups and 22 players have at suited up for the Dubs at some point this season.  first career @NBA points for @MychalMulderpic.twitter.com/SAwMCXyJVN But even through times of change, new Warriors picked up on Green\u2019s talents as a leader, both on and off the court. Forward Andrew Wiggins, acquired by the Warriors at the trade deadline, needed just one game to get accustomed to playing alongside Green. After his February 10th debut with the Dubs, Wiggins spoke highly of Green. \u201cIt was great,\u201d said Wiggins. \u201cHe was a great motivator. He pushes the ball, great leader and if you\u2019re open, he\u2019s going to find you.\u201d Green reciprocated the praise by defending Wiggins, too. The number one overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft, Wiggins had been labeled as lacking in some aspects of the game, but Green sees his potential and wants to bring out his best. \u201cI think he can be an All-Defensive player,\u201d Green said after practice on Feb. 19. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my goals for him, as the leader of this team, one of my things that I really want to push him on. He has all the tools. He has the athleticism.\u201d Green\u2019s ability to connect with his teammates and teach them is something Dub Nation has seen in his eight years with the team. But this keen ability to lead even predates his time with the Warriors.  nice find dray@NBAonTNT pic.twitter.com/xxKjQ1EJv5 In an interview with Boston\u2019s WBUR in February, former Michigan State teammate Anthony Ianni and Associate Head Strength and Conditioning Coach and Director of Sports Science Mike Vorkapich provided details of just how caring Green can be for his teammates. Vorkapich saw the leadership in Green from his freshman year in 2008: \"You know, we lost, and he kind of piped off in the locker room in a good, positive way \u2014 just saying, 'Hey, we\u2019re right there. We're going to get back to this point... We\u2019re going to get back to the Final Four next year\u2019,\u201d Vorkapich recalled. \"And you don\u2019t hear freshmen say that. It was like he took the reins. And that became his team then,\" he said. Ianni joined the team in 2010 and played alongside Green through the next two seasons. He was also diagnosed with autism from an early age, but hid that from basketball teammates throughout his career. The disorder prevented him from understanding some of the jokes from MSU teammates, and that caused a confrontation between he and Green during summer workouts before the 2011-12 season when a joke eventually angered Ianni. \u201cI started arguing with (Green), telling him to quit it, you know, stop. And then he just flat flat out said out loud to everybody, 'Well, if you can't take a joke, then you shouldn't be on this team. You should just go home,'\" detailed Ianni. But when Vorkapich, one of the few people who knew of Ianni\u2019s diagnosis, told Green the issue, he took the initiative not only to talk with Ianni but also ensure he learned everything necessary from there-on-out. As Ianni said, \u201c(Green) said to me, 'Well, first of all, kudos to you. Because look what you've overcome in your life and look where you're at now.' He said, 'Second of all, if you would have told me this from day one, none of this would've happened.'\u201d \"Having somebody with that type of stardom, if you will, to understand what one of their teammates is going through and how they can adapt to that person \u2014 that really showed me not only what kind of a leader that Draymond was and still is, but what kind of a person he is as well,\" said Ianni. Green\u2019s mentality is a reflection of the Warriors\u2019 overall culture that permeates with the players, coaches and even beyond the basketball staff. And though players may come in and out as they have this season, Green takes pride in maintaining the championship mentality of the Warriors even in a down season.  After the Warriors 141-121 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on December 28, Green said: \u201cThat\u2019s the culture that you build. Just because you\u2019re losing games you just don\u2019t throw it by the wayside. You build that for it to last for years to come, so our morale is still good.\u201d You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

Fauci serves as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is serving as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Curry interviewed the immunologist to get the most up-to-date information on the virus, provide insight into best practices during this time, and what can be expected in the future.  Curry: \u201cHow is COVID-19 different from the flu in terms of how it interacts with the body and how it spreads?\u201d Dr. Fauci: \u201cIt\u2019s similar in some respects, Steph, in that it\u2019s a respiratory illness that\u2019s transmitted by the respiratory root. It gives a degree of pathology that\u2019s mostly pneumonia. The reason it\u2019s different is that it\u2019s very, very much more transmissible than flu, and more importantly it\u2019s significantly more serious\u2026 the normal mortality of the seasonal flu that you and I confront every year is about 0.1 percent. The overall mortality of coronavirus is about one percent. Sometimes in China, it was up to two to three percent, which means it\u2019s at least 10 times more serious than the typical influenza.\u201d Curry: \u201cI know we\u2019ve heard a lot of numbers around the discrepancy amongst ages and how it effects people with underlying health conditions or if you\u2019re a little older?\u201d Dr. Fauci: \u201cIf you look at China, you look at Europe, you look at South Korea, it predominantly is reasonably benign if you want to call it that. You get sick, but you don\u2019t get into serious trouble if you\u2019re young\u2026 but what we are starting to see is that there are some people who are younger, people [of Curry\u2019s] age, young, healthy, vigorous, who don\u2019t have any underlying conditions who are getting seriously ill. It\u2019s still a very, very small minority, but it doesn\u2019t mean that young people [like Curry] should say I\u2019m completely exempt from any risk of getting seriously ill.\u201d Curry: \u201cWhat metric are you looking at to be able to determine when large gatherings and sporting events are OK to revisit as not a threat to continue spreading the virus?\u201d Dr. Fauci: \u201cWhat you need to see is the trajectory of the curve start to come down. We seen that in China they went up and down, they\u2019re starting to get back to some normal life. They got to be careful they don\u2019t reintroduce the virus into China, but they\u2019re on the other end of the curve. Korea is doing that, they\u2019re starting to come back down. Europe, particularly Italy, is in a terrible situation: they\u2019re still going way up. The United States is a big country. We have so many different regions like New York City right now which is having a terrible time, and yet there are place in the country that are doing quite well\u2026 we could start thinking about getting back to some degree of normality when the country as a whole has turned that corner and started coming down.\u201d Curry: \u201cI know there\u2019s a timeline for developing a vaccine. I heard it\u2019s a 12 to 18-month timeline to be able to roll that out. What does that process look like and what is the likelihood we get to success in that time?\u201d Dr. Fauci: \u201cWe have started on the development of a vaccine faster than ever in the history of any virus, from the time it was discovered to the time we actually made it and put it into a trial. But when you test the vaccine it takes multiple phases. The first thing you got to do is make sure it\u2019s safe. We started that a couple of weeks ago\u2026 Phase two is pretrial to determine if it works. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s going to take an additional eight months or so. So when you add up the three or four months for phase one plus the seven or eight months, you get about a year to a year and a half. If we really push, we hope that we will know by the time we get into next winter whether or not we have something that works. A vaccine is going to be totally relevant if it cycles into another season, which Steph quite frankly, I think it\u2019s going to do because this virus is very, very transmissible\u2026 I cannot imagine it\u2019s just going to disappear. So vaccines are going to be important the next time around, not for what we\u2019re dealing with now.\u201d You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

As we navigate this unprecedented situation together, the Warriors want to share some feel-good content in the midst of these uncertain times.  The Warriors didn\u2019t know it at the time when the final buzzer sounded, but their 124-119 double overtime victory in Boston on Dec. 11, 2015, would be their final victory of an undefeated start to the season. That victory brought them to 24-0. Warriors Classics: Warriors Improve to 24-0 \t  Warriors at Celtics - 12/11/16 \t  Re-Air: 8 p.m. Tonight on NBC Sports Bay Area     ---> Pause, read that again. 24 and 0. There were plenty of fun moments on the way to the best start to a season in professional sports history, but perhaps it\u2019s fitting that this streak reached its peak with a gutsy, emotionally draining win that tested this team\u2019s metal. And as you\u2019d expect in a game that had a postseason level of intensity, the veterans came through. On his way to a second straight, and this one unanimous, MVP honor, Warriors guard Stephen Curry knocked down a three-pointer to give the Warriors a lead in the final minute of regulation as part of a 38-point night, Andre Iguodala hit a clutch trey of his own in the first overtime period and a sweet dish from Draymond Green and a crafty finish from Shaun Livingston in the second overtime were all crucial plays in a game that featured 22 lead changes and 16 ties. Curry logged 47 minutes in the dog fight and had six 3-pointers to go along with a 14-for-14 performance from the free throw line, and Draymond Green did it all with 24 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists, five steals and a career-high tying five blocks. Iguodala, who hit a pair of game-clinching free throws with five seconds left, had 13 points, and Livingston and Festus Ezeli each had 12 points off the bench. Curry, Green Iguodala and Ezeli all had double-doubles, as the Warriors survived a game in which they were down a pair of starters (Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes), shot 39 percent from the field and made fewer 3-pointers (nine) than the opposition for the first time this season. But the Dubs made the plays when they mattered most, shooting 4-for-7 from the field and 6-for-6 from the free throw line in the final overtime, while holding a gritty Boston club to just 4-of-12 shooting from the floor. The undefeated streak would come to an end the next night in Milwaukee, marking the first defeat of the season and the first experienced by interim head coach Luke Walton, who had stepped in for Steve Kerr for the first few months of the season as Kerr dealt with complications to a pair of offseason back surgeries. As for the winning streak, it actually spanned more than a half year if you go back to the 2015 NBA Finals, when the Warriors won the final three games of the series to take home their first NBA Championship in 40 years.  But the 24 wins to start the 2015-16 title defense season, well that was the best start to a season ever, even better than the 1884 St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association, a predecessor of Major League Baseball. Yes, those St. Lous Maroons.  In the NBA, the 1993-94 Houston Rockets had started the season 15-0, and 21 years later the Warriors improved on that streak by 60 percent. Of those 24 wins, only 10 came on the team\u2019s home court at Oracle Arena in Oakland. 15 wins came against teams from the Western Conference, 13 came against teams .500 or better, and 13 came against teams that made the playoffs a year ago. Six wins came on the back end of a back-to-back, while two came by way of overtime victories, with the 24th and final victory of the streak going to double-OT. Golden State scored at least 100 points in each of those 24 victories, and their plus-340 scoring margin over that span ranks as the third-largest point differential in NBA history through the season\u2019s first 24 games. Simply put, it was an incredible run during an incredible season \u2013 despite how it ended \u2013 during a golden era of Warriors basketball. You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

Stephen Curry entered the Warriors\u2019 home game on Monday, November 7, 2016 against the New Orleans Pelicans coming off of his worst-career shooting performance where he went 0-for-10 from beyond the arc in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Warriors Classics: Steph\u2019s Record-Breaking 13 3-Pointer Night \t  Warriors vs. Pelicans - 11/7/16 \t  Re-Air: 8 p.m. Tonight on NBC Sports Bay Area     --> But in another chapter of of Steph-gonna-Steph, the two-time reigning MVP bounced back in record breaking fashion in front of Dub Nation at Oracle Arena when he broke the NBA\u2019s single game record for three-pointers made in a game. This was not a \u201cvolume-shooting\u201d night either as Curry finished with 46 points while making his 13 treys on 17 attempts, or 76 percent shooting from distance. Curry previously tied the record with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall making 12 3-pointers in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on February 28, 2016, but on this night took sole possession when he knocked down No. 13 with 2:24 left in the fourth quarter in the Dubs\u2019 November game. It was his third trey in a span of 1:11, and amazingly enough, it was the second time in the game that he knocked down three 3-pointers in that time - he also did so in the second quarter. The 13th and final trey of the game helped break the game open for the Dubs, who improved to 5-2 on the season with the win.  \"That was quite a show,\" Head Coach Steve Kerr said after the game. \"Not at all surprising with the way Steph bounces back from bad nights. He's done it throughout his career where he comes right back off of a bad night and lights it up. It didn't surprise me.\" Relive that special evening with Tim Roye and hear from Curry in the Warriors Sound Flashback podcast below. Curry\u2019s record would eventually be topped two years later in October of 2019.

UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR HOMESTAND FINALE Thursday\u2019s Warriors-Nets game at Chase Center will be played without any fans in attendance. This announcement was made on Wednesday in response to the growing concerns about the spread of COVID-19 and in consultation with the City and County of San Francisco. Fans with tickets to the game will receive a refund in the amount paid, and the status of future games at Chase Center will be determined at a later date. In terms of basketball, Thursday\u2019s game will be the second of the two matchups between these squads this season, the first resulting in a 129-88 defeat for the Dubs in New York. Despite the final result, Warriors rookies Eric Paschall (16 points) and Jordan Poole (15) combined for 31 points in the effort.

Team Notes      BKN: TBD. Team Notes BROOKLYN SCOUTING REPORT The Nets currently sit within the Eastern Conference\u2019s playoff picture at seventh place with a 30-34 record, an accomplishment considering they have spent the entire season without All-Star Kevin Durant (ruptured Achilles) and most of the season without Kyrie Irving (shoulder surgery, played 20 games). However on Mar. 7, with just 20 games remaining on their schedule, Brooklyn made a seismic change when they parted ways with former head coach Kenny Atkinson and placed assistant coach Jacque Vaughn at the helm on an interim basis. The team narrowly won their first two games after the change with a 110-107 final over the Chicago Bulls and a 104-102 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert posted over 20 points in each of those games for their new coach. The Nets have seemingly responded positively to their internal change and are coming in hot as winners of four of their last five when they play the Warriors on Thursday.

The Golden State Warriors have won the NBA title.\u201d Warriors broadcaster Tim Roye voiced those words from his perch on radio row on June 16, 2015, at what was then Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, as Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals came to a close with the Warriors winning their first NBA Championship since 1975. After winning Game 1 of the series in overtime, the Warriors lost a pair of close contests and faced a 2-1 series deficit with Game 4 coming up on the road. A change in strategy brought Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in lieu of a traditional center, and the Warriors went on to yield three straight wins to take home the title. Stephen Curry would average 26.0 points and 6.3 assists in the series and Iguodala took home NBA Finals MVP honors after averaging 16.3 points with some clutch 3-point shooting to go along with his tough defense on LeBron James.

FOUNDATION PARTNERS WITH CITY OF HOUSTON AND COMP-U-DOPT TO HELP CLOSE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR STUDENTS AMID COVID-19 HOUSTON, Texas (April 13, 2020) \u2013 In response to the challenges of the digital divide and closing of schools due to COVID-19 precautions, Houston Rockets star, Russell Westbrook and his nonprofit organization, the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation has collaborated with Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner\u2019s Office of Education and Comp-U-Dopt to provide children and families with computers needed to access classwork and digital learning resources online. On March 15, the Texas Education Agency, the governing agency responsible for overseeing primary and public education in Texas, made the decision to close Texas schools amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As the corona virus progressed, school closures were extended through May 4, 2020. The Texas Education Agency then moved to have school districts conduct school lessons via distance learning or digital platforms. However, many students still lack the resources at-home to access their classwork. Since March 18th Comp-U-Dopt has distributed nearly 1,000 computers to Houston families through their Computer Drive-Thru which allows families to register for a computer lottery through their website then if selected, drive through the Comp-U-Dopt warehouse where a computer is placed in their car for them to keep, completely free of charge. 83% of computer recipients are living in households earning less than $35,000 annually and most reside in Mayor Turner\u2019s Complete Communities neighborhoods. \u201cRussell Westbrook proves why he is a champion on and off the court. This donation will be a gamechanger for many students and their families coping with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d Mayor Sylvester Turner said. \u201cThe generous contribution from the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation will help young people stay focused on their education at home and until they can return to their classroom.\u201d \u201cThe generous gift from the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation will allow us to significantly increase our inventory and ensure we can to continue to close the gap for Houston families most in need,\u201d says Colin Dempsey, Executive Director | Houston &amp; Galveston for Comp-U-Dopt. \u201c1 in 3 economically disadvantaged students in the Houston area lack access to a computer at home. With the outbreak of COVID19, and the closure of schools, there is an immediate need to get more computers to students and families without access at home.\u201d The need for computers is significant. Since launching the drive-thru, in just 48 hours, more than 25,000 families registered for their computer lottery and more continue to sign up.\u00a0 In Houston, over 250,000 households don\u2019t have access to a device at home, across the country that number jumps to almost 10 million based on census data. Gifts from partners including the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation are now more essential than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically shifted the education landscape in the United States and Houston. As school districts chart a course forward in the face of uncertainty, teachers are rapidly gearing up to teach virtual lessons and provide learning opportunities to students online, all in an effort to keep students from missing critical learning. All these learning opportunities have one thing in common, they all require a computer. The supply chain delays due to the shut-down in China paired with the global demand for devices also at an all-time high has created a backlog even in devices available for purchase making solutions like Comp-U-Dopt\u2019s one of the only real viable methods of addressing the gap for low-income populations. Students without a computer are at risk of losing months of educational opportunity compared to their peers that can participate. While many families are worried about how they will pay rent, feed themselves, and stay safe, those without a computer also risk missing out on important information from schools about meals and enrichment opportunities as well as other opportunities to earn dollars. Comp-U-Dopt is responding to this need not only in Houston but also working to replicate their model in Chicago, DC, Dallas, New Orleans, and San Antonio. This is a defining moment to consider the future of education and to ensure all students, regardless of their economic situation, have the tools they need to continue to learn. Comp-U-Dopt is poised to broaden and deepen our impact, and with the support of funders including the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation, corporations, and collaboration with cities, and other community organizations, solving this issue is within reach. About Comp-U-DoptComp-U-Dopt is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2007 with a mission to provide technology access and education to underserved youth. Since 2007 Comp-U-Dopt has been providing technology access and education to underserved youth in the greater Houston and Galveston region. To date they have distributed over 16,000 devices to students in need and delivered over 100,000 hours of technology education.\u00a0 Each year they serve 3,000-plus young people from economically disadvantaged families providing computers and quality STEM and workforce focused afterschool programming. www.compudopt.org. About The Russell Westbrook Why Not? FoundationThe mission of the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation is to inspire the lives of children, empower them to ask, \u201cWhy Not?\u201d and teach them to never give up. The foundation works to help children that are facing hardships of any kind and when faced with that adversity fight to succeed and to never give up. Russell Westbrook and his brother were taught to ask, \u201cWhy Not?\u201d every time they were told they could not do something.\u00a0 It is this encouragement and strength that Russell and his family want to spread to children across the country. Founded in 2012, the Russell Westbrook Why Not?

Getting You Caught Up on the Sea Dubs The Sea Dubs have eight games left in the 2019-20 campaign, and they\u2019re all going to be massively important to the team\u2019s playoff outlook. Right now, Santa Cruz is 21-21, a game behind the 22-20 Sioux Falls Skyforce for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and two games behind the 23-19 Stockton Kings for first place in the Pacific Division. There\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room down the stretch \u2013 Sioux Falls has the season series tiebreaker over Santa Cruz, improving to 3-0 against the Sea Dubs after a 125-102 win over the Sea Dubs on Friday night, so Santa Cruz will need to finish with a better record than the Skyforce, and not just be tied with the Miami HEAT\u2019s G League affiliate, in order to earn a playoff berth. On the glass-half-full side of things, Santa Cruz is returning home on a good note, defeating the Iowa Wolves 115-112 Sunday afternoon in Des Moines. Down 89-75 with 4:18 remaining in the third quarter, Santa Cruz held an Iowa team that is fourth in the G League in scoring at 119 points per game to just 23 points over the final 16 minutes to secure the win. It\u2019s going to be a fun/nerve-wracking final three weekends of the regular season. 2.  Revolving Door in Surf City Now a 21-21 record isn\u2019t bad at all, and it\u2019s even better considering the team\u2019s roster situation. Santa Cruz has had a ton of player turnover this season, with 23 guys having already suited up for the Sea Dubs this season (by comparison, the 2018-19 Sea Dubs that went 34-16 and made it to the Western Conference Finals had 14 different guys play). This includes three different players who were bought out of their contracts to go overseas \u2013 Jared Cunningham (China), Devyn Marble (Italy) and Nick Zeisloft (Spain). Buyouts were pretty common back in the day when it was called the D-League, but in the era of two-way contracts in the G League, buyouts don\u2019t happen nearly as often. Having three buyouts on the same team is unusual to say the least.  #SeaDubs BACK IN THE LEADSteal by @isaiahreese13, pass to @ThaRealJsimms, and DUNK by @DeyontaDavis_04 pic.twitter.com/MoJ1hf88WG More importantly, however, is that Santa Cruz hasn\u2019t really had the services of their two-way guys due to all the injuries up in Golden State. The Sea Dubs only got 12 games from Ky Bowman and never saw Damion Lee nor Marquese Chriss when those guys were on two-way deals. And now that Bowman is on a standard NBA contract as well, Santa Cruz is capped at 12 games from their two-way players (of course, they could get guys assigned from Golden State). To contextualize how low that 12-game two-way number is, Santa Cruz had a combined 59 games from two-way contractees Damion Lee and Marcus Derrickson in 2018-19 and a combined 49 games from Quinn Cook and Chris Boucher in 2017-18. By comparison for this season, the next lowest number of games from guys on two-way contracts for a G League team is 28 (Sioux Falls). Don\u2019t take those last two paragraphs as a \u201ccome on, give us more help, Golden State!\u201d plea. That\u2019s the way of the G League. Things happen upstairs that trickle downstairs. This was a pretty unavoidable situation due to all the injuries up in Golden State. There really was no way for Santa Cruz to get more games from two-way players, but it does give some sort of explanation why Santa Cruz won\u2019t match its win total from last season. 3.  Welcome to the Squad, J-Simms    Due to all the roster turnover, Santa Cruz GM Ryan Atkinson needed to land a big fish for the stretch run to try to push the Sea Dubs over the hump and into the postseason. He got one in four-year NBA veteran Jonathon Simmons, who is just two years removed from averaging nearly 14 points per game with the Orlando Magic.  @ThaRealJsimms taking FLIGHT#SeaDubs pic.twitter.com/j4iKhvRsT8 Simmons, who actually made his G League debut at Kaiser Permanente Arena in the 2013-14 opener for Austin against the Sea Dubs, has not disappointed for Santa Cruz, averaging 19.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.4 steals while shooting 49 percent from the floor and 39 percent from 3-point territory in his first five games. He was a major reason why Santa Cruz snapped its three-game losing skid on Sunday, going for a game-high 26 points. Probably the most impressive thing about his stint is that he showed up ready to play in supreme game shape, which isn\u2019t exactly easy to do considering he hadn\u2019t played in a professional basketball game all season. He got into town the day before a back-to-back home weekend set against RGV and his former squad, Austin. He scored 24 points in 28 minutes on Friday and backed that up with a 23-point effort in 33 efficient minutes on Saturday night. As long as Simmons is in town (along with Jeremy Pargo, Andrew Harrison, Deyonta Davis, etc.), Santa Cruz will have a real shot at making the playoffs. 4.  Next Up    The Sea Dubs are back home for a pair of games this week. The 20-21 Oklahoma City Blue come to town on Thursday night followed by a tilt against the Austin Spurs on Saturday. However, due to escalating concerns about the spread of COVID-19, those games will be played without fans in attendance. A win over Oklahoma City would give the Sea Dubs a leg up on the Blue in the chase for the final playoff spot, while a win over Austin would secure the tiebreaker against the 24-17 Spurs should things tighten up down the stretch. These are some crucial games, and though fans cannot watch the games at the arena, everyone can watch live on NBC Sports Bay Area PLUS. You will now recieve Warriors Insider emails!

With so many of us keeping our distance from each other in a variety of ways, we decided to ask some of our favorite athletes to share how they\u2019ve been dealing with life in the Covid-19 world, and how they\u2019re spending their time away from their sport. We had just landed in L.A. Thursday, the 12th. The plane didn\u2019t have WiFi, and my phone was off. So, I didn\u2019t hear anything until we landed. Then, I got everything at once. After we got off the plane, we learned that it was all over. The remainder of the NBA season would be postponed because they were concerned about player safety. And with it being a pandemic, they wanted to make sure that they were taking the right measures for everybody who works in the NBA. That everybody in the organization \u2014 on and off the court \u2014 would be safe. This hit, and it was serious. Our team started doing what the league told them, in order to make sure that everyone was good. I knew, right away, that I was gon\u2019 get back to my family and loved ones. That was the whole team\u2019s priority. It was a trending topic on Twitter \u2014 that\u2019s how I first got hip to everything with the virus spreading. My friends started talking about it, everybody was talking about it. I was aware of it, but once it took hold of the league in the way that it did, I was super shocked. It definitely put people on notice. I was just shocked by the way that it happened. Today is Friday? Yeah. That would make this Day 1. It\u2019s Day 1 that you can\u2019t come to the arena. It\u2019s Day 5 that they\u2019ve had us isolated from each other. They were allowing us in, two and three players at a time, but we just got a text that we had to stop until further notice. I wake up in the mornings like, Damn, I don\u2019t got nothing to do today. My brain, almost instinctively, says, \u201cDamn, I wish I could go play basketball.\u201d I roll over and grab my phone.

He was averaging 18.5 points on 54 percent shooting and 12.4 rebounds (fifth in the NBA) and had just played his best three-game stretch of the season. Over the games at Chicago, at Dallas, and at home against Boston, he averaged 24 points on 62 percent shooting, 12.7 rebounds, and 5.7 assists. He had even hit two of his four 3-point attempts. His legendary father, Arvydas, is suggesting he work on his perimeter shooting in their FaceTime chats while Domantas rides out the NBA's schedule postponement from his offseason home in Los Angeles. BY DOMANTAS SABONIS (as told to Mark Montieth) I flew to Los Angeles the day the season was postponed. I am living here now with my girlfriend, Shashana. Her family lives near here and I'm FaceTiming with my family back in Lithuania every day, so I'm able to enjoy quality time with my loved ones. I wish I was with my family, too, but you can't have everything. You have to make the best of every situation, so I'm trying to learn new things and do things I don't normally have time to do. I've been trying to play the guitar, and we're playing a lot of board games. I had a couple here already and her family has a bunch, so we brought them over here. I'd like to say I'm the Backgammon champion of this house, but I'm not. It's funny, I always feel like I'm running out of time. There's so much to do, I'm not bored at all. Today, for example, I woke up and got breakfast. I'll work out at home for an hour or so, and then we'll bike to my girlfriend's mother's house to spend most of the day there. Her mother has a treadmill, so I'll use that. She has a pool, too, so when it's warm we can swim. They have a hoop over there, but it's an outdoor court. I shoot every now and then but it's hard to do too often if the weather isn't good. One of my friends is building a house and he's going to have an indoor gym, so I'll go over there soon to see if it's done. Forget the house, I want him to finish the basketball court so I can practice in it. If it's done before we go back to playing again, that would be great. I haven't been spending much time on social media. I don't really use Twitter. I can't remember the last time I posted something; I just use it as my newspaper. We don't watch a lot of TV, either, but we've been watching \"Money Heist\" on Netflix. We were already watching it before we got postponed. It's set in Spain, and it's really good. I watched \"The Last Dance\" Sunday night. It was pretty amazing. You never know a lot of what goes on with a team. We come and play, but they don't know what goes on behind the scenes. Maybe something happened that morning that's a distraction, or you didn't sleep well, or your foot hurts. It's completely different than what people think. There's always drama. It's pretty fascinating to see all the inside stuff. We're cooking a lot. I like to cook; it's fun. Sometimes we get lazy and get carryout but usually we cook for ourselves. We've made duck, lamb, ribs, steak, lasagna \u2026 we're baking, too, a lot of cakes. Just a bunch of stuff. I felt like I put on weight the first week we were off because it seemed like a mini-vacation, but then I started eating better \u2013 not eating better, just not as much. We've also been making peanut butter sandwiches and dropping them off for the homeless people in the area. They're living in tents and it was raining one whole week, so we dropped off a bunch of tents and blankets, too. I'm trying to stay in shape. There's a gym here in the condo but it's closed. The only way to get real conditioning is running, but I'm not going to run on the cement \u2013 it's bad for your knees. We've been doing a lot of biking. Some days we try to get a workout, but other days we just bike to my girlfriend's mother's house, about 30 minutes away. I can't do much with weights here. I use a lot of resistance bands anyway and I have bands here. As far as my core and other muscles, I feel like I'm in better shape than before the season ended, but as far as aerobic conditioning you're never in as good of shape as you were when you were playing. I haven't gone back and watched our games yet. I'll get to those soon. It's good to take your mind away from things. It's going to come back and it's going to come back full force. I've been watching a lot of basketball games on NBA TV, though, older games. I've been watching a lot of my dad's games, too. People keep digging around and getting new videos and sending them to me. It's really fun for me to see. He was more versatile than I thought. Now there's a more versatility in the NBA, but not many people can do what he did. I can't even do all the stuff he did. He could spread out the floor and drive. In that era, a guy doing that at his size, it's pretty cool to see. You always hear about it and I had seen some of it, but I've been able to see a lot of his games. It makes me want to work on some things. He's always been on me, saying, \"You've got to get that mid-range shot consistent and then spread out to the 3-point line. Once you do that, they have to respect you. I know you can drive by people. You have all the other tools. It's going to change everything for you. It will make it easier for you to pass, too.\" I'm enjoying myself out here, but I'm missing the team atmosphere - just being around the guys and being with the fans, getting ready for games, all that. We're so passionate, we love the game so much and we have a routine every day during the season. Out here right now I don't even have to set the alarm. I usually get up whenever and go on with my day. But you miss the routine. "}

He's appeared in 29 games with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, averaging 16.6 points and 7.8 rebounds and five games with the Pacers, scoring four points in a total of 29 minutes. Bowen, 21, grew up in Saginaw, Mich. and finished his high school career with La Lumiere in LaPorte. Now the NBA season is on hold he's back in Saginaw, living with his parents. BY BRIAN BOWEN II (as told to Mark Montieth) I was in Fort Wayne with the Mad Ants when the season was called off. I had to stay there for a few days in my apartment to await word on what to do next, and then drove to Indianapolis because the gym was going to be open for the players. That only lasted for one day, though, so I drove home after that. I've tried to stay inside as much as I can, obviously. I'm trying not to take any risks. I've just tried to stay moving, inside and outside the house, but you feel kind of trapped in a sense. It's really tight. It's good to have that family time, though; you miss out on a lot of that during the season. It's been three years since I lived with my parents, so It brings back a lot of memories, for sure. You're rebooting everything back up; it's something you have to go back and get used to. It's good to be back. Occasionally they treat me like I'm still a teenager, but I've enjoyed it so far. My nickname at home is Tugs. When I was a baby, the doctor said I was really tugging on his hair. He said I was like a tugboat. He shortened that to Tugs and it just stuck. My family is big on nicknames. A lot of my teammates use it, too. It's kind of tough, filling the time. I'm on my phone a lot more than I want to be. My screen time is ridiculous. I've had as much as 10-12 hours in one day. That was crazy. I've been watching a lot of television, too. Things like Ozark on Netflix and How to Get Away with Murder. And Tiger King, too. That was different. I had to watch that. But other than that, it's video games or playing card games with the family. During the season I don't play video games very much, but now it's getting ridiculous. One thing I've really liked is being able to eat Mom's cooking. I love it. Spaghetti, salmon, chicken...it all depends on the day. I always have a good breakfast, too. I've been able to keep in touch with the guys on both of my teams. We have two separate group chats going with texts. I probably talk more with my Pacers teammates than the Mad Ants, but there's a lot of communication going on. It's a different time for all of us. We're not used to having this much time off. We don't have a basketball goal in the driveway; after I left home there was no need to have one. But after a couple of weeks here I found a gym I can get into. I go down there three or four nights a week. It's a really small gym, part of a local church. It's got a cement floor, which is even worse than a tile floor like a lot of church gyms have. It's just me and my dad, or maybe my little cousins. I can't do much in there but get some shots up, but any little thing I can do is really helpful right now. I do a lot of ballhandling drills first, either stationary or up and down the court a little bit. I'm working on mid-range stuff and finishing, too. I don't want to overdo it on a cement floor, though, because it gets a little slippery. But it's better than having nothing. I've also turned my dad's garage into a mini weight room. He already had some dumbbells and a treadmill. I just utilize them the best I can. Our strength and conditioning coach, Shawn Windle, gives us a plan for every week that includes different things we can do without weights, if necessary. I brought in resistance bands for strength conditioning, too. I've definitely lost some conditioning. There's no kind of conditioning like game conditioning; you can only maintain so much when you have limited resources. But I try to make the most of what I've got. The thing I miss most is just playing the game. You don't realize how much you love the game until it's taken away from you. Playing the game, and then the relationships with my teammates. Just being around those guys. It's different being face to face and texting. That love for the game really comes out at a time like this. "}

Warren was having the best season of his six in the NBA, all things considered, when the schedule was called to a halt. He was the Pacers' leading scorer (18.7) and shooting a career-high 53 percent from the field. Over the last 12 games, following a three-game absence due to a concussion, he had averaged 21.1 points on 58 percent shooting. Less conspicuous in the box scores, he had become a standout defender after arriving from Phoenix last summer with a reputation as a poor defender. But while he was greatly frustrated by the postponement, he's learning to make the best of his free time. BY T.J. WARREN (as told to Mark Montieth) I stayed in Indianapolis for a week after the season was shut down, and then decided to drive home to Raleigh to ride out the postponement. It's my hometown, I have family and friends there, and I own a home as well, so it only made sense. I'm working out at home with weights in my garage. I try to get creative and come up with different things to do, but I'm just trying to maintain my strength so I'm ready when the season starts up again. I have a gym I can go to as well, where I can get shots up. It's a private gym, but I know somebody who had a key and I go in there by myself and work on things. I try to do something every single day, even if it's just working out or lifting or shooting. I'm not doing the same thing every day, but I'm definitely doing something every day. The first couple of weeks after I got back here it was boring, but I'm trying to take advantage of the time. I'm not trying to count the days any more, I'm trying to make them count. I'm trying to mix up my routine to keep from getting bored. I feel like the days are going by so fast. I've been riding my bike around town or going for a walk. There's a little trail in our Greenway System that's pretty dope. I don't plan anything out, I'm just living on the fly and trying to stay busy. I can't sit around and be upset, so I'm trying to take advantage of it. At the end of the day I'm healthy, the family is good, I'm just trying to be grateful for that and basketball will come back around. This won't last forever. People often say they don't have a lot of time to do this or do that or do something for somebody or for themselves. It's no excuses now. You have all the time in the world to write goals down, to manifest them, to make them a reality. I feel like everybody should have some type of plan to do something beneficial for their life moving forward. I feel like this is the perfect time to have a blueprint for that. I've really wanted to help the people in the medical professions, so I arranged to buy 700 pizzas for the health care workers at Ascension St. Vincent hospitals in Indianapolis. I know they've been working hard with everything going on. I just wanted to give back and provide lunch for them. I'm glad they appreciated it and I appreciate them. They're away from their families and they're putting their lives on the line for the community. I'm also working on some things here, talking with people at N.C. State. They're providing masks every day, and I want to help with that. I see my family about every other day. They check in to make sure I'm good, or I go over there to check in with them. But I try to stay home as much as possible. I'm not riding around trying to see everybody, because of the circumstances. I've been by to see David West a couple of times a week, too. We just talk about everything that's going on. Just life. It's good to hear his voice, especially during these times. We don't really talk about basketball, it's more about where life is headed and what we think is going to happen. He reads a lot and he's very in tune with what's going on. It's good to hear what he thinks. Nobody really knows, though. I just know things won't get back to normal right away, but hopefully we can take steps in that direction. I've been taking more time to read. I've been reading this book one of my friends created and I'm reading a lot of articles, different types of stuff online. Just trying to keep my mind sharp and continue to educate myself. With everything going on with the pandemic, you can get lost in all the information on the internet. I try to keep my mind off it and do stuff to stimulate my mind. I'm not really watching much TV. I'm not a big movie guy or show guy. I've been watching a lot of old NBA games \u2014 a lot of All-Star games, a lot of Kobe games, a lot of Jordan games. I've watched some of our games, too, and clips from our games. I could see the chemistry getting better, from the start of the year to now. I saw a team that was getting hungry and getting healthy and just wanted more respect. Everybody was on the same page and everybody was believing in each other. You could tell the confidence was a lot better. I was slowly taking steps in my play, too. I was getting more comfortable from October to early March. But from watching our games I could see that I need to make sure my presence is felt out there at both ends. Just communicating, being more vocal. My teammates were helping with that and I want to get better at that. We were headed in the right direction with it. We had a good thing going when the season was called off. We were a top-five team in the East, tied with Philly, and we were just about to play Philly on the road so that was our chance to make a statement. We had a lot of goals we wanted to accomplish. Coming back, we want to make it happen in the playoffs. I know everybody is ready to get back and I know everybody is working, so it's going to be good when we get back. "}

The Pacers' first-round pick in 2018 was averaging 23.6 minutes and 9.4 points in 58 games \u2014 26 of which he started \u2014 and shooting more accurately than in his rookie season in all departments. His assist-to-turnover ratio also had improved. He's staying as active as possible from his home on the city's near north side. BY AARON HOLIDAY (as told to Mark Montieth) I'm staying in Indianapolis. I wanted to wait until we get word back form the NBA on what is going to happen with the season. I didn't want to travel to L.A. and back on a flight; that would be a lot with the coronavirus going on. I think it's best to stay here and wait until we decide what we're doing. Mostly I only leave the house to go to the grocery store and then head back home. I've stayed away from public areas. I'm just keeping my distance and staying inside. My cousin lives with me and my girlfriend is here a lot, but she has her own place. My brother Justin is still here in town as well. I saw him one time since the season was called off, but we're keeping our distance and staying safe. Mostly I'm just chilling and hanging out. I go on Netflix and try to watch a show at night. See what I like and don't like. I have nothing but time, so I try to go in and check out different stuff. I try to watch old-school movies if I can, the ones I liked back in the day \u2014 like Space Jam, the Toy Story movies, and The Bourne Ultimatum. I'm trying to get back into video games, too. I'm playing the Call of Duty games. It makes me a little dizzy, but I'm playing games just to pass the time. I haven't watched much basketball. My coaches send me clips from our games, but that's about all the basketball I watch now. My boredom is at an all-time high right now, that's for sure, but I'm not really getting stir crazy. I have a nice-sized backyard and I can go out there and play with my dogs. I have a German Shepherd named Blu and a Pit Bull mix named Ash. My girlfriend brings her dog over, too. She has a Doberman. I've stayed in touch with my teammates, too. We text back and forth \u2014 the whole team, sometimes. We've communicated like we normally do, actually. Mostly texting; it's easier to text than to call everybody. I've been able to work out just about every day. I'm able to just go downstairs and get a workout in. It's easy. Just wake up and go downstairs. It's really nice. Our strength and conditioning coach, Shawn Windle, sends us workouts and I have a workout room downstairs that I built myself. I have dumbbells, trap bars, and a bench rack. I also have a treadmill. There's a program on the treadmill that has intervals on it, so I can adjust that. You run for a certain amount of time, then drop back to a walking pace, and then you go back and run again. It simulates the stopping and going in the game. I don't try to run and lift on the same day. I probably lift three times a week and run on the weekend. If I don't lift Wednesday or Friday, I'll run then, too. I feel like I've been able to maintain my strength at least, if not gotten a little stronger. I can go outside to work on basketball skills. I have a basketball court in my driveway. I just work on shooting, trying to get my form right, and work on dribbling drills. My driveway is kind of hidden, so nobody's come over to try to play with me. I love playing basketball, so it's easy for me to work at it. Once we get going again, I'll enjoy it once again. My mindset is such that I'm really not supposed to be here, so I'm thankful I've been given a chance to play and hopeful I'll get to play again. I say I'm not supposed to be here because I've often been told I wouldn't make it in the NBA. I was too short, or I wasn't good enough, or I'd never be as good as my brothers. Just this and that. I think I'm supposed to be here, but a lot of people didn't think so. Because of that, I make it a point not to take any of it for granted. I know playing basketball isn't supposed to just happen. There are so many people out there who want to be in this position, so I try to look at it as if I'm going out there to make a team every day. I've been able to keep it in perspective, that it can be taken away from you at any point \u2014 which it has been now. I don't know what to expect as far as the season goes. I've heard so many different scenarios of what's going to happen, that basketball is going to come back and it's not. I just try stay level-headed and stay in the present. Try to continue to work out and get better, preparing as if the season's going to continue. If it doesn't, I can't control that. Just do my part and stay in shape and focus on this season. If we get called back, I think we'll have a training camp before we start playing. We'll gradually get into things again. I guess I'll just look at it like the beginning of the season. We have to get ready to play and perhaps play our way into shape. With the time off, obviously we'll be a little out of shape, but I think we can get into shape pretty quickly. Hopefully we can get out there and catch our wind pretty fast. "}

Learn a new skill, perhaps, engage in some form of self-improvement or study a new subject. For Josh Conder and Lori Miser, that meant making protective masks. It figures, really. Conder is the Pacers' Equipment Manager and Miser is the Vice President of Engineering and Construction for Pacers Sports and Entertainment. They've got a natural inclination toward making and supplying things, and masks have been at the top of everyone's list of items of that need to be made and supplied. \"Everybody across the country needs a mask,\" Conder said. He had to start from scratch, which meant purchasing a sewing machine, fabric, and elastic and teaching himself what to do with it all. He had always wanted to develop sewing skills in case he needed to make a quick repair of a torn uniform or attach a patch to a jersey, and this was the perfect opportunity. He faced an early delay because he had to take the machine in for repair almost immediately \u2014 either he broke something or it was defective, he didn't yet know enough to know \u2014 but then went to work. A few of his first efforts had to be tossed, naturally, and his first usable mask took about 45 minutes to complete. But now that he's got the hang of it, he can make 10 or more during that time. He's made about 160 so far. He donated 100 to a police officer who is a member of a homeless task force, and he's given about 20 to relatives and friends, including some of the players and their wives. He has no plans to stop. \"I plan to keep doing it,\" he said. \"I enjoy it. It passes the time.\" Miser had a head start on Conder, having already acquired some sewing skills. Although she's still busy with construction and engineering at The Fieldhouse and still making occasional trips into her office, she's found time to make about 100 masks. \"I've had a sewing machine since I was a kid and messed around with it,\" she said. \"I can make table clothes and curtains, anything in a straight line and no zipper. But I saw all this stuff on social media about how to make masks, so I thought I'd give it a shot.\" Miser has incorporated various patterns into her masks, including some with the Pacers logo. She started by giving them to security team members at the Fieldhouse and practice facility but has since branched out to supplying family and friends. She was delayed early on by the lack of available elastic (\"about as hard to find as toilet paper.\") but once her order arrived last week, she's kept a steady pace. When time permits, she can crank out six to eight per hour. \"There's women out there who have made hundreds. That's not quite me, but I wanted to do something to help the (virus) situation because I'm concerned about it.\" Have a question for Mark? Want it to be on Pacers.com?

{"team": "pacers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/pacers/news/pritchard-focused-patience-and-discipline-during-unprecedented-times", "date": "2020-04-14 00:00:00", "tags": ["Pacers", "Kevin Pritchard"], "article": "  Pacers President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard spoke to the media via Zoom video chat on Tuesday afternoon, a sign of the current state of things in the NBA and the world at large. Pritchard fielded questions about all aspects of the Pacers' current situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as keeping in touch with players, the potential of a return to play, and the complications of preparing for the NBA Draft during uncertain times. \"We're doing everything we can do to keep together,\" said Pritchard from his kitchen. \"We're going to have an extreme amount of patience and we're going to have to be disciplined.\" When asked about the potential for some of the various scenarios of returning to play that have been floated in the media, Pritchard stated that he has full faith in NBA commissioner Adam Silver's judgement on when and how the NBA returns to play and that as of right now, the league is still in the process of charting the best course of action. \"I don't think anything is going to be talked about or announced until early May, so that would be probably the earliest that we would hear anything,\" he said. From talking to the players, Pritchard said that he feels the team has a real hunger to take the floor and believes that the group was just starting to hit its stride before the hiatus began. \"They want to prove that this team is a good team in the playoffs,\" he said. \"They want to show that they're a tough out.\" \"We think we can make some noise in the playoffs,\" he said. On the injury front, Pritchard mentioned that Malcolm Brogdon \u2013 who had been sidelined with a torn left rectus femoris \u2013 is feeling 100 percent ready for a return. \"When I communicate with Malcolm, he's just ready to go,\" Pritchard said. \"He was so looking forward to getting some games with Victor before the playoffs. Malcolm is so hungry.\" Pritchard also made clear that he believes teams would need more than a few weeks of time to ramp up activity for their players to get a point where they are at peak form and not risking injury. \"I don't think it's going to be one week and 'let's get back and play some games,' I think they are going to give us a good amount of time, but I don't think it's going to be a week. I would say two or three weeks minimum, and then play some games. But we're going to have to be cautious.\" During the stoppage, Pritchard has taken aggressive steps to keep the players connected to one another, checking on the team frequently during video chats and having the training staff send workout regimens to keep the team in shape. \"We get online for an hour or hour-and-a-half once a week and we just check in with the players.\" Pritchard has been impressed with how proactive members of the team and company have been in finding ways to contribute positively to the community during this crisis. \"What I've been most proud of is how some of our players are using this platform to help. Victor and Tamika, they did their public service announcements. And I know Malcolm is coming out with a program right now.\" Beyond the hurdles of planning for the postseason, Pritchard also addressed how the Pacers are prepping for the draft despite so many unknowns. Instead of getting hung up on what they can't do, Pritchard has his team locking in one what they can do. \"We can watch film, we can ask people about players, and we can make our evaluations.\" he explained. \"I think our analytics department is probably as busy as they've ever been, because they're working on new projects. We're not sitting idly, I can tell you that.\" With the front office becoming acclimated to their new reality of remote work and social distancing, Pritchard believes their discipline has the franchise on solid ground. And now it's just time for patience, with the timeline of how and when a return will occur still obfuscated by forces much larger than basketball and beyond anyone's control. But when play is eventually resumed, Pritchard knows the Pacers will be as ready as anyone to return to the hardwood. \"I think we have an amazing basketball culture (in Indiana) that is being missed right now and I can't wait for us to get back to that.\" "}

Participants include: \"We owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women on the front lines of the pandemic, helping to care for our community's most vulnerable residents,\" said Mayor Joe Hogsett. \"These healthcare professionals and first responders are truly heroes and Thursday's nationwide celebration is an opportunity for residents to show their appreciation. As Indianapolis comes together and lights the community blue, it is my hope that Indianapolis also renews its commitment to staying home, staying safe, and easing the burden on frontline caregivers.\" In order to comply with current city and state orders designed to flatten the curve, Hoosiers should stay home and follow social media for photos and video feeds of the lights. There are other ways for individuals or local businesses to get involved while also practicing good social distancing. Ideas include wearing blue clothes, displaying a #LightItBlue sign in their windows or creating a display out of homemade signs, blue streamers or balloons. Those that have the ability to turn their outdoor lights blue are encouraged to do so. Everyone is also encouraged to show their support of healthcare workers and first responders online with the hashtags #LightItBlue and #INthistogether. "}

Pacers coach Nate McMillan refers to his star guard's upbeat demeanor as \"sunshine,\" while Pacers President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard has termed it \"infectious.\" Oladipo once again showcased that positivity when he spoke with the Indianapolis media for the first time since the NBA suspended its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, chatting with reporters on Thursday evening via conference call. Though the sudden halt to the season came just six weeks into Oladipo's return after a full year of rehab, he said on Thursday that he is choosing to see the positives in the stoppage, especially as the world deals with far more serious issues. \"Still working, still rehabbing,\" he said. \"Even though the world is kind of slowing down, it's given me a chance to reset.\" The two-time All-Star made his season debut on Jan. 29 after a year-long absence due to a ruptured quad tendon. He played in 13 games, starting 10 before the season was suspended and was playing his best basketball before the abrupt stoppage. Oladipo hit the game-winning shot in the Pacers' 112-109 victory at Dallas on March 8. He followed that up with his best game of the season two nights later in Indiana's last game before the hiatus, scoring a season-high 27 points to go along with seven rebounds and four assists in a 114-111 loss to the Celtics at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on March 10, going 9-for-16 from the field and 5-for-7 from 3-point range. Still, Oladipo said he was not frustrated that the stoppage came so soon after he appeared to find another gear and that it could end up benefiting his long-term health. \"I can look at it like I was just getting my rhythm back or my flow going, or I can be optimistic and look at it as an opportunity to rest and to still have an opportunity to continue building strength in my tendon, let the body be able to heal naturally,\" Oladipo said. \"To say I was 100 percent out there, I don't know that I can say that, coming off an injury...I have no control over COVID-19. I have no control over what's going on right now. But I have control over my mentality. Even though there's limitations, there's still ways I can get better.\" Despite social distancing restrictions, Oladipo has been able to work out every day. He transformed his garage into a weight room and also has access to a private gym, allowing him to do exercises to continue to strengthen his surgically repaired quad tendon and knee. Oladipo admitted that it has been \"a little weird\" to be separated from the rest of the world, but he has found ways to stay busy. He said he has spent a lot more time reading and writing, two activities that he enjoys but doesn't have much time to do during the grind of the NBA season. Oladipo has also been active on social media during the hiatus. He performed a live concert on the NBA's Instagram account on March 27 and on subsequent Fridays has hosted \"BASE:LINE Live,\" a live concert series featuring UnitedMasters independent artists, on the NBA account. Like the rest of the world, Oladipo said that the global pandemic has put a lot of things into perspective for him, especially the power of sports. \"They say that sports has a way of bringing people together,\" he said. \"You don't really realize it until now when there's absolutely no sports anywhere. \"It doesn't only provide opportunities for different people from different ethnicities and different backgrounds to come together and root for one common goal, it also just brings entertainment. It brings excitement. It brings happiness. So the fact that all those things have been taken away from society, it's been a major hit for us.\" While Oladipo does not know when he might get a chance to take the court again for the Pacers, he looks forward to the day when the NBA and sports can resume and is hopeful that it can help offer joy after an unprecedented time of crisis. \"I think that sports starting up again would be beneficial not only to us as athletes, but to the entire world,\" Oladipo said.

One year ago today, the Clippers completed the greatest comeback in NBA playoff history by storming back from 31 points down with 7:31 left in the third quarter to shock the two-time defending champion Warriors at Oracle Arena. It wasn\u2019t the first statement win of the season \u2013 they had erased three 20-plus-point deficits on one February road trip alone \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t be the last, as they would return to Oakland just a week later to take Game 5 in much more convincing fashion. But this was the one that will live on forever. Today, we look back to the night of April 15, 2019 through the lens of our Clippers photographers. It would be easy to get caught up in the moment. Facing the heavily-favored Warriors, already down a game, in a building designed to blast the opponents\u2019 senses to smithereens. But Lou Williams, the Underground GOAT, isn\u2019t hearing that noise as he finds some calm before the storm. The team huddles up in the back tunnel of Oracle Arena before taking the court. This group has formed an identity from overcoming adversity. Facing the prospect of falling down 0-2, the goal tonight is to win and force a return for Game 5. The rules are the same, but playoff basketball is different. Cameras everywhere, but Patrick Beverley stays locked in. Just two months into his tenure with the team, rookie Landry Shamet has established himself as an integral piece of the Clippers\u2019 offense with his shooting ability. But in this series he embraces the responsibility of guarding former MVP Stephen Curry. Heart over height. \u201cI try to be the best defender on this f****** planet,\u201d said Beverley after this game. \u201cConsistently, in and out. I take my role, I take my job very seriously. I do it for my teammates. I understand my role and I understand how to get stops. KD isn\u2019t an easy cover but it\u2019s fun out there for sure.\u201d Steady as ever, Williams kicked it into high gear for 29 of his game-high 36 points in the second half. \u201cIf you play long enough, you\u2019ll find your running mate,\u201d says Williams about his pick-and-roll partner, Montrezl Harrell. The O.G. added 11 assists to his stat line, here feeding his wing man Harrell, who imposed his own will with 25 points and 10 boards on the night. The Clippers inch closer and close the gap. Landry Shamet finished with a modest 12 points, but connected on four attempts from downtown and nailed the dagger to seal the victory with 15.9 seconds left. After the game, he\u2019d proclaim \u201cBINGO\u201d to be his favorite word in the English language. Perhaps the most iconic photo of the season, Pat and Trezz unleash raw emotion as they celebrate walking off the floor. Two of the most demonstrative forces on the team, our photographer knew who to target as the final buzzer sounded. Steve Ballmer sets the tone for the Clippers organization and the team embodies his unbridled competitive spirit. After a win like this, he and Doc Rivers can hardly contain their excitement. \u201cWe are not going anywhere,\u201d Rivers told his team in the locker room. \u201cWe\u2019re roaches, they can\u2019t kill us!\u201d The iconic line became a rallying cry for the team, which went on to defeat Golden State again at Oracle in Game 5. The line was subsequently featured in the movie \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d The epitome of cool, before, during and after the game. Lou Williams famously doesn\u2019t eat much on game days, so here he refuels, snacking on arena nachos while scrolling social media on the training table. "}

Along with Fiserv Forum and the Bucks, the organizations involved in MaskUpMKE are:\u00a0Rebel Converting,\u00a0Medical College of Wisconsin\u00a0(MCW),\u00a0Greater Milwaukee Foundation,\u00a0Zilber Family Foundation,\u00a0United Way of Greater Milwaukee &amp; Waukesha County\u00a0and\u00a0Milwaukee Habitat for Humanity. Rebel Converting, a Saukville-based manufacturer of hospital-grade disinfectant wipes, is making and donating the face coverings. The first of three semi-loads of kits were delivered to Fiserv Forum on Wednesday, April 22. Approximately 3,500 kits containing materials to make a total of 2.5 million face coverings will be brought to the arena. \u201cThe Bucks and Fiserv Forum are dedicated to doing our part to keep the community strong and healthy during the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d said\u00a0Bucks Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility Arvind Gopalratnam. \u201cWe are pleased to be part of the important MaskUpMKE initiative with Rebel Converting, Medical College of Wisconsin and so many generous and knowledgeable local organizations.\u201d In addition to the 2.5 million face coverings that are being brought to the arena, Rebel Converting previously made and donated an additional million for the community. This makes for a total of 3.5 million face coverings in order to address the growing need for personal protective equipment. \u201cRebel Converting is proud to be producing 3.5 million face mask kits for our community, and we are excited to receive this substantial commitment from the Bucks and Fiserv Forum to help us to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives,\u201d said Rebel Converting Owner Mike Kryshak. \u201cWe are looking forward to working with the Bucks and Fiserv Forum to help us distribute these mask kits and get them into the hands of our local health care heroes and community workers in the metro Milwaukee area.\u201d Healthy individuals are invited to visit\u00a0United Way\u2019s MaskUpMKE site\u00a0to sign up for a volunteer shift and schedule a time to drive by the Fiserv Forum loading dock to pick up a box of face covering kits to take home for assembly. The pick-up times take place daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. over the next two weeks beginning on Saturday, April 25. Kits contain instructions and materials to make 700 face coverings. Each face covering takes approximately one to two minutes to assemble. Volunteers will return their boxes to Fiserv Forum upon completion. Before and after completion, volunteers will answer questions to ensure they are not exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, among other precautions. MCW has been involved in MaskUpMKE to advise on the public health aspects of the entire project. After a 72-hour quarantine period, the face coverings will be distributed to the community under the guidance of MCW. Milwaukee Habitat for Humanity will also assist in the physical distribution to those most at risk of contracting COVID-19. \u201cThe Medical College of Wisconsin stands behind its commitment to the community now in one of its greatest times of need,\u201d said Christopher Davis, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Surgery, Division of Trauma/Acute Care Surgery, at the Medical College of Wisconsin. \u201cIn collaboration with the Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Institute for the Transformation of Medical Education, many MCW staff and students have worked tirelessly to spearhead the production and delivery of nearly 250,000 non-surgical masks to community health clinics, essential workers, and nearly 100 local social service agencies. As recommended by the CDC, these non-surgical masks act as face coverings to help prevent the spread of virus from people speaking, coughing or sneezing who might not even know they are infected.\u00a0Face coverings are for wearing when performing essential tasks away from home and are not a substitute for staying home as much as possible, keeping six feet away from others, and frequent hand washing.\u201d Community organizations in need of face coverings can submit a request by visiting\u00a0https://www.maskupmke.org/request.html.

Why that season? Because they were right between when he was a rookie coming off the bench attempting a couple shots per game and when he became an All-Star in his fourth season. Giannis and the Bucks are in the midst of an\u00a0all-time great season, both separately and together. This was almost impossible to imagine a few years ago. These plays are not just the highlight dunks or plays that you might be used to seeing from his early years. They are just some of my personal favorites at the time (looking back at notes from then) or in retrospect. Plays that might otherwise be lost to time from his ascendant years. Here are 20 plays from Giannis in 2014\u201315, his second season in the league, that showed how Giannis always had\u00a0feel\u00a0and it. Hate to do it but have to start with this block against new teammate Marvin Williams in the season opener. Plenty more where that came from.

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to aweb browser that supports HTML5 video.  Giannis scored four points in this game in 12 minutes. He is now scoring more points per minute this season than all but two players in NBA history. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t doing this 10 times a game at this point, but it was just as un-guardable when he did. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to aweb browser that supports HTML5 video. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to aweb browser that supports HTML5 video.  In the first six games of the season, Giannis averaged 1.5 free throws made per game. In this game, the seventh of the season, Giannis hit 6\u20137 from the line, and you can see in this and-one that he had it in him to be a dominant finisher.

This functioned as a preview of what Giannis now does all game every game, which is grab the basketball until it goes in. He has gotten even better at making sure it goes in. Also, this was the very early stage of Giannis dominating the Knicks, which he is made a habit of doing for the last five years (more on that later).

On this night, he set a new career-high with seven assists, and didn\u2019t turn the ball over.\u00a0This was the sweetest of his seven assists on this night, spinning one-on-three, hinting at both his one-on-everyone future as well as his team-over-everything nature.

The two held a virtual media availability via Zoom. This is the second availability the team has had. Earlier this month, Rosas and head coach Ryan Saunders addressed the media. The cloud of Jacqueline Towns\u2019 death is hanging over the Timberwolves\u2019 organization, and that\u2019s what Rosas addressed to start. COVID-19 hit home for the Timberwolves 10 days ago when it took the mother of Karl-Anthony Towns. Teammates are texting and calling Towns. Beasley\u2019s texted a handful of times, as has his mother. There have been team chapels and prayer services. But amidst all of this, the face-to-face element has been taken out of this and that\u2019s made it even harder for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s been terribly difficult. Anytime you lose somebody, especially somebody as important as a parent, you want to be there for them and you want to support them,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried really hard, anything and everything that we can to connect with Karl and his family. . . . It\u2019s not the same. You can\u2019t hug somebody; you can\u2019t spend 1-on-1 time with them. You can\u2019t help them through this pain in a physical, personal way. . . You just want to grab KAT, give him a hug and let him know that we\u2019re here with him.\u201d Beasley\u2019s family has unfortunately also been impacted by the virus. He had a family member on his mother\u2019s side pass away recently while trying to battle COVID-19. While Beasley has been getting in daily workouts, it\u2019s been difficult for him to think about what might be ahead for the NBA during this uncertain and uncomfortable time. \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about that right now,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cMy main concern is my family and my son . . . We\u2019re all trying to make sure we\u2019re healthy.\u201d This has been the longest Beasley has been away from basketball since he was a baby and that\u2019s probably similar for a lot of other players in the NBA. It\u2019s wild to think that it was more than a month since everything happened in Oklahoma City when the Jazz announced Rudy Gobert had tested positive for the virus. The Timberwolves were set to play the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Mar. 13, two days after the NBA announced the league would put the season on hold. \u201cWe were supposed to go to OKC and be in that exact locker room,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s crazy and you just gotta be thankful we didn\u2019t\u2019 fly down there that night. It\u2019s just crazy that we\u2019re home right now.\u201d There has been a lot of talk lately about what will happen with the NBA. Will the league resume the 2019-20 season in a \u201cbubble city\u201d as some have reported? Could teams use practice facilities to play regular season and playoff games until fans can attend arenas again? There\u2019s no answer to that. And while Beasley is ready to get back to it, he understands the big picture. \u201cI\u2019m ready to get to it,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cEither way, I just want to make sure our health is fine. Basketball will always be there. I just gotta make sure we\u2019re healthy.\u201d "}

We\u2019ve already watched the Game 82 classic that clinched a playoff spot for the 2018 Timberwolves. Behind Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota earned the eighth seed. Their reward was to go up against the 65-win Rockets. Oh fun. The Timberwolves nearly pulled off the Game 1 upset in Houston, but fell 104-101. Game 2 was one to forget, with the Wolves falling 102-82. Game 3 was significant. Not only for the series, but for the Timberwolves. They were headed back to the Target Center and it was a chance for their fans to be there for NBA playoff basketball for the first time since 2004 when the Timberwolves advanced to the Western Conference Finals. After trailing 28-27 in the first quarter, the Wolves came out roaring in the second, scoring the first six points. The Timberwolves would eventually lead by 11 points after a Derrick Rose layup with 4:05 left in the second quarter. But the Rockets did what they do best, drilling four 3-pointers, closing the lead to just 52-51 at half. If you wanted energy, coming out of the halftime break, Timberwolves\u2019 fans brought all of it. That trickled down to the players. \u201cThe fans were great, the crowd was great,\u201d Timberwolves forward Taj Gibson said. \u201cLike I said from Day 1, we\u2019re doing this for Minnesota. The fans pushed us over the limit, they were in it the whole game. We felt the energy. One thing about this crowd, they let you know when you\u2019re playing bad and let you know when you\u2019re playing great.\u201d Gibson was the only starter not to score in the third quarter for the Timberwolves as they outscored the Rockets 35-24 in that 12-minute stretch. Karl-Anthony Towns and Jeff Teague had eight points each, while Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins added seven. That gave Minnesota a 12-point lead heading into the fourth. The Rockets got within nine, but the Timberwolves shut the door to that pretty quickly and walked their way to a 121-105 win, their first playoff win since May 29, 2004 in the Western Conference Finals. \u201cBottom line, one they played well, they played with a little more emotion than we had, a little harder,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said after the game. \u201cEspecially in big moments they came up with either a stop or a score and we didn\u2019t battle enough to overcome the crowd and the emotion that they had and give them their due.\u201d The Timberwolves would lose the series 4-1, but that Game 3 was full of so much emotion and the franchise was finally able to retire the \u201chaven\u2019t won a playoff game since 2004\"\u00a0headline.

We bought a flex pack for the 2015-16 season then would randomly make our way back to the arena for random matchups we wanted to see. However, I decided to go all out and buy lower-level tickets for his belated 22nd birthday gift in 2018. Ricky Rubio (absolutely terrible game to watch Rubio in hindsight) was coming to town and neither of us had Halloween plans so I chose the Oct. 31 game against the Utah Jazz. Plus, the Wolves were wearing my favorite classic black trees jerseys. But the appeal of the game was downgraded 10ish hours before tip-off. I believe this was one of the first games \u2014 if not the first \u2014 Jimmy Butler sat out due to \u201cgeneral soreness\u201d while the Wolves were negotiating trade deals to please the player my brother and I once adored. Tyus Jones (another one of my brother\u2019s favorites and everyone\u2019s for that matter) and Jeff Teague were also ruled out for the game due to injuries. It soon felt like I had chosen the wrong game to splurge on. Then Derrick Rose happened. Say what you want about Rose, but that man objectively balled that night. Rose got off to a solid 13 points on 50% shooting from the field and I remember being slightly impressed but not overly dazzled at this point. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get there. There were quite a few early turnovers, but Josh Okogie brought the energy Butler once provided when he was promoted to the starting lineup and tasked with defending Donovan Mitchell. Mitchell was also a player I knew my brother would be excited to see, but Okogie held him to just five points on 2 of 8 shooting. Another game, another Josh Okogie defense to offense highlight that makes you happy. pic.twitter.com/h7g5GfxoKu \u2014 Kyle Ratke (@Kyle_Ratke) November 1, 2018 Another game, another Josh Okogie defense to offense highlight that makes you happy. pic.twitter.com/h7g5GfxoKu \u2014 Kyle Ratke (@Kyle_Ratke) November 1, 2018  I think my brother was wondering if he should invest in an Okogie Prince-themed jersey at this point. The answer is always \u201cyes.\u201d Mitchell improved throughout the game, but the Wolves stayed afloat because of Rose. Rose was 1-for-5 in the second quarter, which, of course, adds to just how unbelievable his second half was, but he had one of the wildest shots where he faded on one leg and tossed a shot up over Rubio before catching his balance near the game\u2019s photographers. That is the moment we should have known it\u2019d be a spooky night. The Wolves held a nine-point lead heading into the third, and I specifically remember covering my face with my hands as Rose continued to attempt circus shots over Rubio and Rudy Gobert. The shielding wasn\u2019t necessary for nine of those 11 shots, however. Karl-Anthony Towns, who added 11 points in the third, had quite a few screen assists that quarter and Gobert, the self-proclaimed king of screen assists, would sink back in the paint ready to contest the shot attempts of Rose, someone 10 inches shorter than him. Mind you, Gobert went on to be named the league\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year at the conclusion of this season. But height and defensive talent don\u2019t matter when it comes to Rose wizardry. I didn\u2019t hear this the night of the game, but I appreciated all the Halloween puns Dave Benz had that night when I went back and re-watched it. \u201cIt\u2019s been all treat and no trick,\u201d Benz said. Good stuff. a spooky sight for defenders. pic.twitter.com/llgg8AArBv \u2014 Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 1, 2018 Rose and Towns combined for 30 points that quarter but didn\u2019t get much help from the supporting cast. Mitchell found his rhythm and led a Jazz comeback that gave Utah a one-point lead with just over three minutes remaining in the third quarter, but another Rose-over-Gobert floater led a slight charge that gave the Wolves a 101-96 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Target Center was obviously impressed with Rose at this point given he was up to 35 points and shooting 50% from beyond the arc, but I don\u2019t think the absurdity of the moment began to sink in until the game got down to the wire. As I re-watched this, I was thinking, \u201cWhy is CJ Williams getting minutes and running the point to start the fourth?\u201d and I was probably thinking the same thing in the arena. Rose\u2019s play was so invincible that I couldn\u2019t comprehend how tired he must have been. But with Rose out, the Jazz took a 9-0 run thanks to Jae Crowder and Gobert\u2019s defense. Rose returned out of the timeout and Jim Petersen recalled having coins thrown at him by Jazz fans when he\u2019d play in Utah. Wild stuff. Andrew Wiggins hit his third 3 of the night to tie the game and get the crowd excited again, but Rose had probably his worst spurt of the night and committed three turnovers to give the Jazz a two-possession lead. Rose had four turnovers this quarter and was noticeably disappointed with himself after each one despite having 35 points in the first three quarters of the game. Rose made his first bucket of the quarter before Anthony Tolliver picked off the Jazz\u2019s inbound pass and found an open Rose in the paint. Rose went down hard on his shot attempt, hit his head but recovered. Did he ever. The crowd was on its feet now and Rose received \u201cMVP\u201d chants as he went to the free-throw line. Those \u201cMVP\u201d chants always seem over the top to me, but that night they felt special for the 2011 MVP who was giving us a vintage D-Rose game seven years later. With his next field goal, Rose was just one point shy of his previous career-high of 44 points. This was his first 40-point game since March of 2011. And we were in awe of 42 points at the time. The game was tied with about a minute to go, and this is where my brother, the biggest Towns fan I know, started to get annoyed by Rose\u2019s dribbling and was hoping he\u2019d look to dish to Towns instead of playing hero ball. But Rose continued to make him bite his tongue as he gave us a classic Rajon Rondo fake-pass bucket. I still have a video on my phone that perfectly encapsulates the absurdity of the moment. Derrick Rose\u2019s 50-point game will be re-aired on @fsnorth at 6 p.m. CT tonight. This video pretty much encapsulates how I felt that entire night watching DRose. pic.twitter.com/geEipTYMvk \u2014 Katie Davidson (@ByKatieDavidson) April 12, 2020 The Jazz went on to get a foul call against Tolliver, but Gobert missed one of his free-throws and the game was tied at 123-123 with 36.9 seconds to go. Out of the timeout, Rose dribbled to the rim and absolutely dangled Dante Exum, this time hitting a fadeaway floater. One day I\u2019ll rank all of his crazy shots from this game. Thirty seconds left, two-point Wolves lead, two Rose points away from 50. Rose\u2019s 50 came at the free-throw line where he gave the Wolves their final 128-125 lead and plenty to celebrate. I went home and wrote about the game until 5 a.m. for the old blog I used to write for. That post detailed what a breathtaking night it was for Rose but you have to consider the greater context to fully appreciate what that night was like in Target Center. The Wolves had been lambasted by Butler throughout October and were constantly in the national basketball news because of Butler\u2019s antics. But that night, the Wolves, thanks to Rose, had some positive news to share with the basketball world and were headlining ESPN for all the right reasons.  @drose\u2019s 50-piece re-airs tonight on @fsnorth at 6PM! A @budweiserusa Legendary Moment pic.twitter.com/cb6plSlWEe \u2014 Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) April 12, 2020 Rose needed that game, and so did Wolves fans.

Up to that point, the Timberwolves had made the playoffs just once in 1996-97 with a record of 40-42. The Bulls, led by that Michael Jordan guy, had made the playoffs in every one of those seasons and had won five NBA championships. They\u2019d win No. 6 in 1997-98. While 0-16 seems extreme, the Timberwolves were finding their footing in the league after some rough years to start, while the Bulls had the best player to ever play the game. The Timberwolves got close to taking down the Bulls on Feb. 16, 1996. Minnesota lost 103-100 at Target Center. Isaiah Rider\u2019s 29 points weren\u2019t enough against Jordan and Scottie Pippen\u2019s combined 64 points. When teams have not-so-great streaks like this, mental roadblocks start to appear. It\u2019s also easy to get in your head when you\u2019re playing against someone like Jordan, who nobody in the league had any answers for. During the 1996-97 season, the Timberwolves were swept again by the Bulls. Minnesota\u2019s next chance to knock off Chicago was on Dec. 30, 1997. It was pretty unlikely considering the Bulls had just rattled off eight-straight wins. Then again, the Wolves had won three-straight games and they were catching the Bulls on the second half of a back-to-back. For me, this game was a bit before my basketball-watching prime. In 1997, I was seven years old. I can\u2019t say that I remember watching the early days of KG and Stephon Marbury. As far as Jordan goes, I probably remember him more during his stint with the Wizards than with the Bulls. I\u2019m not sure if I should be embarrassed by that, but whatever. This is a fun game to rewatch. You get to hear Kevin Harlan\u2019s voice call the game, before he was THE\u00a0Kevin Harlan.\u00a0His partner in crime was former Gophers star and Knicks player Trent Tucker. Chicago was led by Jordan and Pippen, but of course there was also Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper and Steve Kerr. As for the Timberwolves, this was Kevin Garnett\u2019s third season in the league while it was Marbury\u2019s second. Behind these two, the Wolves were supposed to be the next big thing in the West. Of course, you can\u2019t forget Tom Gugliotta as the third member of this. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to take a trip down memory lane (if it is indeed in your memory) or for some, to watch the game for the first time, on Apr. 9 at 7 p.m. CT on Fox Sports North. A few things to watch for: After starting 0-16 against the Bulls, the Timberwolves are 26-17 since. Turns out when a team doesn\u2019t have the best player in the world, it\u2019s good news for the opposing team. FSN\u2019s Jim Petersen and The Athletic\u2019s Britt Robson will be live-tweeting the game. You can follow Petersen\u00a0here, and you can follow Robson\u00a0here. "}

This interview was edited and condensed for clarity. Ratke: A lot of people reading this probably don\u2019t know what it was like watching Michael Jordan in his prime or obviously being on the court with him. What was it like playing against those Bulls teams and Michael in particular? West: Oh wow. Well for me, basically because that was my matchup every time we played them, it was a nightmare. (laughs) I mean, it was definitely exciting, arguably the greatest player who\u2019s ever played, great competitor. The hard part for guys like myself as I said, every time he came or their team came into your arena, the fans were really there to see him. It was like, they introduced Michael Jordan and he got a standing ovation from the fans at Target Center. It was like, \u201cWow.\u201d So this guy is coming in, he\u2019s kicking our butt \u2014 at that time I think he was averaging like 36 points a game \u2014 and the fans wanted to see spectacular plays from him. But on the other side, you wanted to compete, you wanted to give your all and you wanted to try to win the games so you had to try to do what was necessary to try to take away some of that fanfare. Ratke: I think (the Timberwolves) started 0-16 against the Bulls before you guys beat them in \u201997. You only played them twice a year, and it wasn\u2019t like they were a rival, but were you guys aware that you hadn\u2019t beaten them yet? West: Well for me, because I had been there since the inception of the Timberwolves in 1989, I knew very well that we had not won. What I didn\u2019t realize until we watched the game was that Scottie Pippen didn\u2019t even play in that game. So there\u2019s probably an asterisk because Pippen didn\u2019t play, but of course it was definitely a great accomplishment for us. I think Kevin was in his third year, Steph was probably in his second year, so it was a big accomplishment for us. But just as I was re-watching the game a few days ago, I didn\u2019t even realize Pippen didn\u2019t even play. Ratke: Going from being a guy who averaged four points per game in his second year to jump to 19 in your fourth year, that\u2019s a real good run as a player. What was it about Minnesota early on that allowed you to develop as a player? What are some of your early memories of the Timberwolves? West: I thought we had a good flow of players coming through. We unfortunately didn\u2019t win a lot of games. We changed over coaches a lot, so that was always difficult. But I thought the year that I averaged 19 points a game, I always tell people nowadays, \u201cYeah, I averaged 19 points a game, but we only won 16 games.\u201d So you had to bring some more firepower in there. As Kevin McHale took over and Flip came into the forefront, you could see the development of a team of some chemistry coming in. I can recall when we were drafting Kevin Garnett, thinking to myself, \u201cWe\u2019re finally turning the corner, and we\u2019re drafting a kid from high school.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know about this high school player?\u201d Well, fortunately for him and fortunately for us, he was an outstanding talent, outstanding teammate, outstanding competitor and he was able to put 20-plus years in the NBA and is now a Hall of Famer. I think that the Wolves were always going in the right direction. I just think that it was building blocks slowly through players, through drafts, trying to figure out the draft picks, trying to figure out what worked and what didn\u2019t work. But the great thing about Minnesota was that we always had passionate fans. We had fans that came out every night. I heard you guys had a pretty mild winter, but you know what those winters can be like trying to come to those games. We had a good fanbase, great support from the city, and even to this day I tell people one of the nicest places I\u2019ve ever lived or been in my life was Minnesota. They always talk about it being cold, but those summer months were just amazing as well. Ratke: As far as KG goes, I don\u2019t think anybody knew just what he\u2019d become. Do you have any KG PG-13 stories that you can tell us? West: I always think of one of the best KG stories. It was probably from his rookie year. Spud was on the team and we were in Dallas to play a game, and I think the Super Bowl or some football game was on. Spud had everyone over to his house \u2014 I\u2019m almost positive it was Spud \u2014 and we were there watching the game, doing what we do, and all of a sudden, Kevin disappears. Well, Kevin\u2019s outside playing basketball with the kids in the neighborhood, just shooting hoops with the kids in the neighborhood, just being always attuned to playing basketball and working on his game. Ratke: With him and Steph, I think that\u2019s like the question Timberwolves fans will probably hold on to maybe what could have been with those two. How special were those two in the first two or three seasons of them playing together? West: Well of course, KG coming in he was a spectacular player on the defensive end. He could score, but Steph brought out a new pace to our team being able to push the ball, being able to find guys wide open. You always had to be prepared for the basketball coming to you at any time. Steph was also a great finisher. Unfortunately those two just couldn\u2019t get it together to continue on, because I think that if they would have played together for many years, a lot of good things would have come for both of them as teammates. It\u2019s just unfortunate. Ratke: Obviously the league has changed a lot since you guys have played. I was watching that Bulls game and Steph hit that 3 in the third quarter and it was the only 3 that the Wolves made that game, and the Bulls only made 5 so it wasn\u2019t like they were making it rain either. When you look at how the game has changed, do you think about how maybe your game would have changed if you were a young player today? West: I never think back on how my game would have changed. I came into college before the 3-pointer was in college. The 3-pointer got put into college my last two years in college. So the 3 wasn\u2019t a big part of our game coming up. Every era has something different. I actually enjoy the game now, though. Even though we didn\u2019t shoot a lot of 3s back then, I thought the flow of the game was a lot better back then. It\u2019s pretty similar to what it is now. I thought there was a point for about eight or nine years where it just became one-on-one basketball. I just think there\u2019s a lot of great shooters and a lot of guys who\u2019ve learned how to play the game off the ball. Fortunately, the game isn\u2019t as physical as it was when we played. It was a very physical game back in the \u201880s, \u201890s. "}

This interview was edited and condensed for clarity. Ratke:\u00a0Going up against Michael Jordan in the mid-\u201890s, I think probably a lot of people, myself included, probably weren\u2019t of age to really remember what watching him was like and how good he was. What was it like going up against him? Gugliotta:\u00a0Yeah, (the Bulls) were the perennial powerhouse. You kind of knew they had bigger fish to fry. Their goals were championships. You definitely knew when you stepped on the court with Michael Jordan, it was the one guy you just had to look at for a little while just to be like \u2018Wow, there he is.\u2019 All the stuff he\u2019s done and the reputation he\u2019s built, when there was a moment, say the start of the game at a jump ball, you just had to get a glance at him and just be like \u2018Wow, he\u2019s really there. He looks just like he does on the commercials.\u2019 He was one of those iconic players like when you think of Kobe and LeBron. The one that you really take a moment to look at even though you are a peer and someone who is playing against them. You kind of have to collect yourself because you\u2019ve seen so many things about him before you got to play against him and there he is in the flesh. Ratke:\u00a0I think the Wolves were 0-16 to start out against the Bulls and have a winning record since. It turns out when the best player in the world leaves, it\u2019s good for the other teams. You guys won that game. You and Stephon Marbury had 23 points each. Just looking back at photos of Steph, there\u2019s one of him talking trash to MJ and MJ is just kind of blowing him off. What was a young Steph like? Seemingly he just had all the confidence in the world. Gugliotta:\u00a0No doubt. I recently just caught up with that game to refresh and I think second half, he missed five-straight free throws and just to show you about his confidence and he was not hesitant to go right back at the basket. There was no question of how confident he was, and he knew he would make the next shot. And if he didn\u2019t, it would be the next shot. He was certainly very confident. He was an outstanding player. Obviously, they had a hard time guarding him. He was getting to the basket when he wanted to, making plays and creating his own shot. I would say his confidence was the biggest thing going for him that night. He wasn\u2019t that special that night, but he carried through just because his confidence never wavered. Ratke:\u00a0Timberwolves fans will always wonder what would have happened if Steph and KG would have stayed together. You were a big part of that team. Maybe it\u2019s because they were younger, but people forget how good you were in your prime. Do you ever think about what could have been with you three in Minnesota? Gugliotta:\u00a0Yeah, I guess in hindsight a little bit. Especially those two being about the same age and maybe at the time it would have been the Stockton-Malone kind of comparisons that were going on because of a great point guard and obviously a great big man playing together for 10-12 years. You know, you always kind of think about it. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be, really. Surely, I would have loved to been part of something like that. You know, things happen. It becomes a business more often than not. You don\u2019t necessarily pick and choose what your destinations are. As far as those two especially, to see them play for a decade or more, that could have changed the whole franchise even more. They had some great runs, but you might have had better players that wanted to come along and play with them because they were close. It didn\u2019t happen and I know I appreciated my time greatly and playing with the coaches and the fans don\u2019t get any better. I guess I just look at it that I\u2019m thankful I had that opportunity to play in that city with that team. Ratke:\u00a0You were back in Minneapolis not too long ago for the State Fair and you did some stuff with us. Coming back for you, what was that like? Maybe you don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019re appreciated or missed until you come back and you hear the \u2018Googs\u2019 chants. Gugliotta:\u00a0Those are my fondest memories playing in the NBA. It was probably the best few years of my career. It was one of the few times I played on a really good team and a player that was on the team before got good, and we kind of took off after we drafted Garnett and then Marbury, and then added some good veterans like Terry Porter and Sam Mitchell. You knew you had Kevin McHale who knew basketball and played on great teams and had an idea of how to build a team. Looking at that, it was an awesome feeling for a player. I played for the Bullets and I was on the Warriors before they got good again, but we were 22-25 win teams. Out of 82 games, that\u2019s no fun. I think very fondly of my time there and it certainly exceeded my expectations of how it is to live there, the people that live there. It was just incredible and I\u2019m thankful I had that opportunity. Ratke:\u00a0You talked about how the NBA is a business and I think we see all the time where there are young, promising teams. A few years ago, it was the Wolves with Karl-Anthony Towns, Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins. Everyone thought that was the next big thing. But every few years there\u2019s a team like that and then something happens. How fragile is it to keep a young and talented team together given all the factors at play? Gugliotta:\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Free agency is kind of at its peak. You can almost create your own team if you\u2019re a good enough player and you have a buddy and you can each get two or three guys and all a sudden you have six really good players and you got to city X and make it happen. It doesn\u2019t always work out, but it does happen and it takes players away from teams that would have been good. But you also have these kids \u2013 that\u2019s what happened to (the Wolves) when I was 28. These kids are 18 or 19. And to be honest, they\u2019re all fighting for not only the money, but the love and the publicity and the stuff from their own city. If they think someone is encroaching on that and they\u2019re still not winning, then they think that other guy should go, and it should be them that\u2019s the focal point. It\u2019s part of the soap opera. That\u2019s part of the allure of the league, what people also like watching. It is a soap opera. It\u2019s not all just lovey-dovey. It\u2019s not just \u2018Get a team and work hard and see where it goes.\u2019 There\u2019s a constant positioning and fighting. It\u2019s very competitive people. The owners and GMs are competitive and the player that is trying to make a living and career is of course ultra-competitive. It doesn\u2019t always turn out pretty, and then you leave it up to sometimes 20-year-old kids and that\u2019s kind of what you get. "}

For 19 games, Zion Williamson was an inferno. He finished over, around and through players who are paid primarily to protect the rim. He ran faster and jumped higher than any 285-pound person should be able to, and he made an art form out of sealing his defender near the rim in transition. His alley-oops and early post-ups felt almost unethical, as if the New Orleans Pelicans were exploiting a loophole by putting someone that massive and explosive near the basket. "}

Up next is P.J. Carlesimo, an NBA analyst for ESPN's TV and radio programs. This is the first of two parts of Joel's conversation with P.J. Joel Meyers: Ever since you left the bench, you\u2019ve been on ESPN. Whether it\u2019s on TV or radio. Do you find yourself looking at games just to kind of be prepared, be ready just in case we\u2019re back in June or July? P.J. Carlesimo: Between doing the interviews, that kind of keeps me in it a little bit. If Indianapolis or ESPN calls up, I\u2019ll pull out the stats from what they\u2019ve done so far. That kind of keeps me in it. What I\u2019ve found I\u2019m doing a lot of \u2013 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for you \u2013 is that I\u2019ll get a call from San Antonio that says they\u2019re playing game six tonight from the 2003 finals. I\u2019m very conversed in with things that happened 20 years ago. I\u2019m not as good as what\u2019s happened recently. People every once in a while want to know what\u2019s going to happen. I just think it\u2019s going to be so different for all these teams to try and build the bridge back to where they were. In my mind, it was no question that the Lakers and the Bucks were head and shoulders above everybody else at that point when we went down. I know people are talking about the Clippers and when they get healthy and all this, but I mean I thought those two teams had distanced themselves from everybody else. Now it\u2019s totally unchartered territory. We know what it\u2019s like in October and November when the ball is kind of going all over the place and you start going, \u2018Well, hey. It\u2019s going to take a while to get in basketball shape and it\u2019s going to take a while for these teams to come together.\u2019 Yeah there\u2019s a big advantage in that they\u2019ve played 50 or 60 games. That\u2019s good, but it seems so long ago and conditioning is going to be such a challenge. I think there will be some guys in very good shape because of what they\u2019ve had access to in terms of being able to work out and I think other guys are not going to be in good shape at all, particularly basketball shape, because they haven\u2019t shot the ball that much. Joel Meyers: You\u2019ve coached at the highest level for a long time. Do you go back and re-live \u2013 and you brought up 2003, 2005, 2007 where you won rings as an assistant coach with Gregg Popovich. The game that stand out in my mind, for you, is 1989\u2026the upset of Bobby Knight and Indiana 78-65 and then the No. 1 seed at the time, the Michigan Wolverines. Do you go back? Do you look at that? When is the last time you saw that, because I still don\u2019t think it was a foul with three seconds to go. Rumeal Robinson goes to the line. Do you go back and revisit that at all? P.J. Carlesimo: I don\u2019t. I used to get calls \u2013 I still will \u2013 when ESPN Classic replayed the game. I always get a bunch of texts or phone calls the next day or sometimes that night. I remember a couple of times checking into hotels late at night, as you and I are used to when a team gets to a city, and all of the sudden the phone will ring, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re playing the championship game.\u2019 I don\u2019t watch it. I don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ve seen the clip of the play itself a number of times, but I haven\u2019t gone back to watch it. It\u2019s funny living in Seattle, that game of course was in the Kingdome in 1989.\u00a0 I swear \u2013 I\u2019ll say a month, I used to say a week \u2013 a month doesn\u2019t go by that two or three people don\u2019t stop me and say, \u2018Hey I was at that game.\u2019 I think I\u2019ve talked to 200,000 people that claim they were at the game. It\u2019s a good memory because that whole trip \u2013 the five wins preceding the one-point overtime loss to Michigan \u2013 we really enjoyed. It was a special team, obviously, and it was a great time. I actually got a chance to talk about it a lot a month or so ago when they cancelled the NCAA Tournament because the last game I did this year was Dallas at San Antonio on March 10. Pop and I of course went out to dinner after the game and we were sitting there and had a really nice meal, and I flew out to Las Vegas the next morning intending to do the Pac-10 tournament. I was going to watch the first day and then we were going to so the semis and the finals. I was looking at three straight weeks of the NCAA Tournament for Westwood One. It was a great schedule because I had a couple of Monday and Tuesday NBA games snuck in there. It was going to be my busiest four weeks of the year, then of course the plug got pulled with Rudy Gobert and Utah/OKC that night. Then I started getting \u2013 the following week or whenever it was when the NCAA made the decision \u2013 what is it going to be like for these guys to not get a chance to play in an NCAA Tournament? People would ask me, \u2018What was that like? Making a Final Four run or playing in a championship game.\u2019 I said it was a once in a lifetime experience. Unless you\u2019re Duke, you don\u2019t get a chance to do that that many times. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get back, it\u2019s great. That is once in a lifetime for our seniors \u2013 that team that we had had about six or seven seniors. You look at the guys this year. I\u2019m close to Mark Few \u2013 he\u2019s not that far from here at Gonzaga over in Spokane. Seton Hall had one of their best teams this year. They had big guys; they had Myles Powell, a great guard. I think there were more teams this year with a realistic chance to win the tournament. Everybody always says they can win it, but usually it\u2019s three or four teams or five. This year I think there were 10 teams that literally could look around and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re good enough to win this whole thing.\u2019 Those teams, particularly the seniors, are never going to get a chance. Even the teams where you have guys coming back, it\u2019s not the same thing. It\u2019s not the same team. It\u2019s sad if you\u2019ve experienced it because it\u2019s such a phenomenal event, particularly for a senior or a team like Dayton or San Diego State this year. Not that Dayton will never get back there or San Diego State will never get back there, but those were really special teams and everybody wanted to see, \u2018Hey, can these guys play with the teams from the power conferences?\u2019 Obviously you\u2019ll never know. Compared to what\u2019s going on, is that all important? No. But for a lot of these guys and girls, it literally was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Joel Meyers: A couple of years ago Donte DiVincenzo had an amazing run and championship game for Villanova. Those opportunities were lost for guys that wanted to advance to the NBA. P.J. Carlesimo: No question. The Final Four for a lot of people define their careers with what they\u2019ve done there. Donte is the perfect example. I saw him a lot because I still do some Big East Conference (games). Jay Wright is a good friend, so I watch them. I like Donte. I had him the year before in the regional, I think when they beat Texas Tech, and I really liked him. I thought he was a good player. Even when he was drafted I said, \u2018Boy, people are really overreacting to what happened in the Final Four.\u2019 Having covered Milwaukee a couple of times in the past few years \u2013 last year he was banged up \u2013 he\u2019s really a good player. He\u2019s an excellent player. Like you said, that wouldn\u2019t have happened without the Final Four\u2026it wouldn\u2019t have happened that year without the Final Four experience. Joel Meyers: Let\u2019s move on to the Spurs. You\u2019re with them in \u201903 and they win the title in six games over Jason Kidd and the Nets. It\u2019s Tony Parker\u2019s second year, Manu Gin\u00f3bili is a rookie. Then (2005) comes up, Brent Barry is added (along with) a couple other guys, (Bruce) Bowen is already there. Then 2007. What stands out in your mind about those three championship ruins with Gregg Popovich? P.J. Carlesimo: I\u2019ll tell you what really surprised me, as I\u2019m getting toward senility and you\u2019re knocking on the door too. I had forgotten so many things about that game six. (My son Kyle) watched it with me. The game is over and Kyle says, \u2018Timmy (Duncan) had a quadruple-double.\u2019 As it turned out, the stat crew messed up; they only had him for eight blocks to go with I think 21 points, 20 boards, and 10 assists. The game was ridiculous how well he played. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s ever had those kind of numbers in a clinching game in the NBA Finals. What I had forgotten, I\u2019m watching the fourth quarter and we\u2019re down seven or nine points (and) go on a 19-0 run, which I forgot. Steven Jackson had three threes, Speedy Claxton was unbelievable. Jack and Speedy finished the game like Pop always did: if guys were going good, you didn\u2019t necessarily go back to the starters or go back to who he would finish a game with. Jack hit three threes in that 19-0 run. Speedy was unbelievable, I think he had two buckets. David (Robinson) is playing his last game. You couldn\u2019t have had a more fairy-tale ending to a career. David is playing at home in, I think, the first year of the AT&amp;T Center. There were so many different story lines, but to me\u2026Tim was the constant. There\u2019s no question about that. I had no recollection that he literally had a quadruple-double in that game. I\u2019m watching one of the other games against Detroit, I think in game seven in 2007. He blocks a shot \u2013 which again, other guys swat the ball out of bounds and then walk around like a rooster. Timmy would block the ball softly up in the air and catch it himself and he got control of it. He dribbles the ball up the floor, he stops and hit a top of the key jump shot, we\u2019re down five. It\u2019s a huge play, and he stops and knocks down a jump shot. I\u2019m sure sitting on the bench, I was thinking, \u2018What is he doing?\u2019 Of course he knocks the shot down, we cut it to three and end up winning the game. If a guy can be underrated, and yet at the same time go into the Hall of Fame which he\u2019s doing this year, it\u2019s Tim Duncan. You know him. He\u2019s a better person than he was a player, but I almost had forgotten just how special Tim Duncan was through those three championships. When you look at it, it was one in \u201999 and another one in \u201914. So I guess he got five championships. Joel Meyers: Pretty amazing individual, as you said. You coached Kevin Durant his rookie season. Did you have a good feel that this guy was going to be that good at that time? I remember sitting down with him at Key Arena when you were the coach, a couple of hours before game time. I asked him about that commercial where he was walking through the tunnel by the locker room and taking off all of those jerseys\u2026his first Nike commercial. I asked him about it and said, \u2018Who is Drew Freeman\u2019s All-Stars?\u2019 and he smiled and he goes, \u2018That was my middle school.\u2019 Did you realize at the time \u2013 because you had him his very first year \u2013 did you realize Durant was going to be this good? P.J. Carlesimo: I actually did and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m insightful or know basketball, it\u2019s because Stevie Wonder would have known (laughter). If you watched one practice, there was no question. I remember calling Rick Barnes, I was standing in our bedroom in our home in San Antonio where you and I had a glass of wine or two (laughter) and I called Rick up when I thought I was going to get the scout job and I said, \u2018How good is he, I\u2019ve seen him on TV,\u2019 and he kind of said the same thing we said about Timmy (Tim Duncan). He said \u2018let me tell you, he\u2019s a gym rat. You\u2019ll have to kick him out of the gym. All he wants to do is be a great player. He\u2019s a great teammate, he\u2019s unbelievable, he can shoot it, he\u2019s so skilled, you\u2019d be shocked at how big he is, and, here\u2019s the best news; he\u2019s a better person than he is a player,\u2019 I mean it was like he couldn\u2019t have been bubbling over more. So, we get him, I get the job, I think I had to stay for the press conference or something like that. The team is in Vegas getting ready for Summer League and Ralph Lewis is coaching the team, one of our assistants, and we go and watch five minutes of a practice and I\u2019m going \u2018holy God,\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. I wish I had tapes because I remember some scrums after some practices when we got back to Seattle and we\u2019re getting ready to start the season in October and people saying how good he was, and I remember saying specifically, because I didn\u2019t want to put too much (pressure) on him, that we weren\u2019t going to be a good team, I think he\u2019ll be a 8-10-time All Star, he may be good enough to make a run at MVP, he\u2019s going to win championships in the league, and (the media) is looking at me [surprised], because he was really skinny, really thin, and (the media) said \u2018wow\u2019 and I said \u2018I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sticking my neck out. You guys watch him play and you\u2019re going to believe it,\u2019 you know, they could only watch 10 minutes of the practice and we hadn\u2019t had any games except Summer League games at that point. If you had watched him play and particularly if you knew him, if you got to know the person, I mean he\u2019s like, you know, people talk about (Michael Jordan) and watching the series now and people still talk about LeBron, rightfully so, Kobe, of course, those guys out-worked the other players in the league. It\u2019s a bad combination when a guy naturally has more talent than most of the other players in the league, but then he has a work ethic and he out-works the other players in the league that are less talented, then they\u2019re going to be a real problem. We\u2019d come back from a trip, and I\u2019d be sitting in my office, and any time I heard a ball bouncing at two or three-o-clock in the morning I knew who it was. I got a kick out of it, you literally had to kick him out of the gym, and there\u2019s nothing you could ask him to do that he wouldn\u2019t do. He was that motivated to be the best player, and even later in his career. Right now, still, I guarantee when he comes back, there\u2019s no question how he\u2019s going to come back. It\u2019s physically possible he\u2019s going to come better than he was because he\u2019s going to be out-working these people. Right now I guarantee he\u2019s working as hard, if not harder, than anybody in the NBA right now. That\u2019s Kevin Durant, and it was real easy to see how good he was going to be.

If you were to pick a word that most concisely describes the status of the 2020 NBA Draft, it might be \u201cuncertain,\u201d in more ways than one. Not only were the league\u2019s 30 teams deprived of a sometimes-significant component of player evaluations \u2013 college basketball postseason tournaments, including the conference and national varieties \u2013 but due to the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s impossible to conduct in-person interviews and workouts with player prospects. Furthermore, since the 2019-20 regular season is not yet completed, the 30 NBA teams do not know exactly where their picks will fall in the two-round event, or even an exact date for when the draft will take place. The highly-anticipated annual gathering was scheduled to occur June 25, but right now the entire basketball calendar is \u201cto be determined\u201d (by the way, the \u201920 lottery was supposed to be May 19). At the moment, mock-draft prognosticators are going by how the NBA standings looked when play was suspended March 11. For New Orleans, that means a temporary projection of owning a total of four picks, with one in the first round (the Pelicans would theoretically hold the No. 13 pre-lottery slot) and three choices in the second round (picks 39, 43 and 60, according to NBADraft.net\u2019s mock draft). As Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin put it during an April 9 conference call with local media, the current 2020 draft situation is difficult to compare to any other since he\u2019s been part of NBA front offices over the previous 20-plus years. \u201cWe\u2019ve got less to go on this year than we have in the past, simply because we saw less of the college basketball season coming down the stretch,\u201d Griffin said, referring to the lack of tournaments. \u201c(But) we certainly feel like if the draft were held tomorrow, we\u2019d be prepared to do so based on how we go about the process (of) scouting.\u201d Another facet of the normal draft process that may not be possible this year is the combine, which in recent years has been the held the same week of the draft lottery in Chicago. Without the combine and the opportunity to meet with potential draftees in person, it could be a bit more challenging for teams to get an intimate feel for players off the court. \u201cAbsolutely, between now and when the draft is held, our reality has changed quite significantly in terms of the way we go about it,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is where we\u2019re trying to be as creative as possible. We\u2019ve talked about having more Zoom interviews (via video chat), but maybe we try to incorporate some other activities in those things than we have in the past.\u201d NBA teams also often hold draft workouts for players in their respective cities and practice facilities, but that also appears to be a potential no-go this year. However, Griffin indicated that he has not put a great emphasis or significance on them. Teams putting too much stock into them are subject to mistakes, based on extremely impressive or poor performances during workouts, which usually last only a couple hours. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been a team that puts a lot of credence in the workout anyway; (the pre-draft process is) really more about learning about the human,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cBut maybe there\u2019s some things we can do interactively with the draft-eligible (players this year) that we haven\u2019t done in the past.\u201d Owning four draft picks gives New Orleans enviable flexibility and the potential to go in a number of different directions. One thing seems fairly certain about the \u201920 draft for the Pelicans, however: They\u2019d love to have as positive of a night as they did last June, when the talented and promising haul included No. 1 pick Zion Williamson, No. 8 Jaxson Hayes, No. 17 Nickeil Alexander-Walker and second-round wing Didi Louzada, who spent the season developing in Australia\u2019s pro league.

The NBA\u2019s 2020 draft was originally scheduled for June 25; the date is now to be determined. As frustrating and forgettable as the 2018-19 season was for New Orleans, in hindsight the misery inadvertently generated multiple long-term benefits that could pay off for years to come. First, after making a trip to the second round of the playoffs in \u201918, no one expected the Pelicans to miss the postseason in \u201919, let alone have a realistic shot at prized No. 1 pick Zion Williamson, but that\u2019s exactly what happened. A disappointing 33-49 record yielded New Orleans \u201cso you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance\u201d lottery odds of just 6 percent, yet the ping-pong balls bounced fortuitously, causing Alvin Gentry to erupt in a back room in Chicago. A month later, the blockbuster Anthony Davis trade with the Los Angeles Lakers yielded a second lottery pick, which the Pelicans converted into center Jaxson Hayes. Just like that, New Orleans had added a pair of promising 19-year-old bigs (Williamson was actually still only 18 on draft night). It probably wasn\u2019t by design, but last summer proved to be rather bountiful for New Orleans in terms of adding players with noteworthy draft pedigrees. After a multi-year stretch during which the Pelicans frequently traded out of the first round, New Orleans managed to acquire four other players who\u2019d been selected during previous NBA lotteries. The deal with the Lakers brought Brandon Ingram (No. 2 pick in \u201916) and Lonzo Ball (No. 2 pick in \u201917); Derrick Favors (No. 3 pick in \u201910) and JJ Redick (No. 11 pick in \u201906) were added via trade and free agency, respectively. Add it up, and the Pelicans currently have seven players on their roster who were chosen during the draft lottery (since Charlotte rejoined the NBA in \u201904, that\u2019s been defined as any player among the first 14 picks). Somewhat surprisingly, that\u2019s actually not the most in the league, because there are three teams with eight former lottery picks on their rosters \u2013 Chicago, Houston and Orlando. Based on current rosters, here are the teams with the most and least lottery picks: MOST Chicago Bulls (8) Th.Young (No. 12 pick in 2007), O.Porter (3 in 2013), LaVine (13 in 2014), Dunn (5 in 2016), Valentine (14 in 2016), Markkanen (7 in 2017), W.Carter (7 in 2018), C.White (7 in 2014) Houston Rockets (8) T.Chandler (2 in 2001), Sefolosha (13 in 2006), J.Green (5 in 2007), Westbrook (4 in 2008), E.Gordon (7 in 2008), Harden (3 in 2009), Rivers (10 in 2012), McLemore (7 in 2013) Orlando Magic (8) Augustin (9 in 2008), Aminu (8 in 2010), Ross (8 in 2012), Carter-Williams (11 in 2013), A.Gordon (4 in 2014), Fultz (1 in 2017), Isaac (6 in 2017), Bamba (6 in 2018) Boston Celtics (7) Hayward (9 in 2010), Kanter (3 in 2011), K.Walker (9 in 2011), Smart (6 in 2014), J.Brown (3 in 2016), Tatum (3 in 2017), Langford (14 in 2019) New Orleans Pelicans (7) Redick (11 in 2006), Favors (3 in 2010), Okafor (3 in 2015), Ingram (2 in 2016), Ball (2 in 2017), Williamson (1 in 2019), Hayes (8 in 2019) Phoenix Suns (7) Rubio (5 in 2009), Saric (12 in 2014), Kaminsky (9 in 2015), Booker (13 in 2015), Ayton (1 in 2018), Mik.Bridges (10 in 2018), C.Johnson (11 in 2019) LEAST Toronto Raptors (1) S.Johnson (8 in 2015) Milwaukee Bucks (2) M.Williams (2 in 2005), B.Lopez (10 in 2008) Brooklyn Nets (3) Durant (2 in 2007), Irving (1 in 2011), Prince (12 in 2016) Denver Nuggets (3) Vonleh (9 in 2014), Murray (7 in 2016), M.Porter (14 in 2018) Of course, a quick glance at the \u201919-20 standings shows that accumulating numerous lottery picks isn\u2019t exactly a recipe for short-term success. In fact, the defending NBA champions (Toronto) and the squad with the best record this season (Milwaukee) only sport three combined lotto choices, including none they drafted themselves. Along similar lines, when the regular season was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic, at the top of the list of goals for New Orleans (3.5 games behind eighth-place Memphis) was to qualify for the 2020 playoffs \u2013 which means skipping the draft lottery and avoiding adding another top-14 pick.

Not only will you enjoy walking through this quiet and beautiful neighborhood, but also you'll be treated to the best view of the city of New Orleans, hands down. So let's get going. As always, feel free to break off this route and start one of your own, but this should be a decent starting point. I started this walk at the corner of Verret and Alix streets in front of the Holy Name of Mary Catholic Church. Head south down Verret toward the Crescent City Connection, which will come into view in a couple of blocks. Eventually, you'll come to Opelousas Avenue, the southern boundary of the neighborhood. Take a left onto Opelousas and enjoy the oak tree-lined view. I couldn't help but think how much this street reminded me of Esplanade Avenue, which of course, we traversed a week ago. Continue on Opelousas for about six blocks till you come to Atlantic Avenue. Hang another left and head toward the levee, which will be in view the entire way. Walking up Atlantic took me back to playing baseball not very far from where I was at Skelly Rupp Stadium in my teens. It also made me think of some of the athletes that called the West Bank their home. From Reggie Wayne to Patrick Surtain, to present day Deion Jones and Landon Collins who played on the same football team at Norman Playground in Algiers, there is no shortage of stars who began their careers here. Another of those is Steve Barrios, who grew up in Gretna, and prepped at West Jefferson. Steve was a wide receiver at Tulane University and was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2000. A part of Tulane football broadcasts for over 30 years now, Steve recalled some of those greats beginning with a certain Baseball Hall of Famer. \"My main playground was Knights Corner or Mel Ott Park, named after THE Mel Ott, who was born in Gretna, moved on to a fabulous pro career, inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951,\" Barrios said. \"If you look up his stats, it's really just incredible. Hit over 500 home runs and had a .304 lifetime batting average. So he's kind of, I think, the most famous person from the West Bank, even though in latter days a lot of guys have come from there that are really big names. \"Other guys that have come after me but guys that I really admired coming from the West Bank, one of them being Kordell Stewart, who went to John Ehret High School. He had a fabulous high school career even though he didn't play ball until his junior year. Then he went to the University of Colorado, had a great career there, then drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers where he became known as \"The Slash.\" The first quarterback/wide receiver/running back, he gave fantasy football players fits because they didn't know if he was playing or what position he'd be.\" Steve also gave an interesting take on how prep athletics and the talent has really blossomed in the last few decades. \"When I came up there were only two high schools on the West Bank, that was West Jefferson and Berhman. All the smaller high schools had morphed into junior highs, and the junior highs morphed into West Jefferson, so that made West Jeff a powerhouse...but now the West Bank is just flooded with high schools. You have John Ehret, Edna Karr, O.P. Walker, Helen Cox. All of these schools they compete now and do quite well, so the athletic landscape has really changed tremendously. The West Bank still puts out a great number of high school athletes not only recruited locally but kids wind up going other places. It's simply because there's such a great crop of high school kids coming out on the West Bank every year.\" When you get to the levee, you will have gone one mile. Now comes the best part. Take a quick right on Patterson Road and go about 50 yards to the paved entrance to the top of the levee (unless of course you want to run up it through the grass). The top is two lanes and paved the entire way. You have the option to go east or west, but, trust me, on your first time you'll want to head west toward the skyline of New Orleans. You'll be able to see St. Louis Cathedral directly in front of you with the river on your right. It's also interesting to hear the very high river lapping at the concrete levee just a few feet below.  From now through the end, just enjoy the view of the city, which you can almost reach out and touch. You'll come up on Algiers Point itself, then, as you veer south again, the Algiers Point Terminal, where you can take a ferry to the East Bank. Pass the Terminal, and you're greeted by a large statue of Louis Armstrong and the beginning of the Robert E. Nims Jazz Walk of Fame. Highlighted by French Quarter-style lamp posts and ample paving, the Walk honors great jazz musicians of yesteryear, apropos considering Algiers is the birthplace of Jazz. Continue heading this way toward the CCC.  The levee is paved so you can walk as far as you want to, but for distance sake I continued until I reached the bridge, then turned back around, with the river now on the left. This time when you reach the Terminal, veer to the right and head to street level parallel with the levee, which is Morgan Street. In a couple of hundred feet you'll pass a historic landmark for the second time, the Algiers Courthouse.  Homestretch time. Morgan Street becomes Patterson Road and you'll be going against traffic so head to the sidewalk. Head east a few more blocks till you see the sign for Verrett. Take a right and head back down Verrett till the original starting point at the Church. You're done! Hope you all enjoyed this one as much as I did. As I mentioned with the Mid-City walk, the best compliment I can give it is that I'll do it again, very soon. You will certainly want to head back to enjoy those levee views that are second to none. If you want to just walk the levee for however many miles, you can do that too. We'll talk again soon. Stay safe everyone. View the discussion thread. Check your email for more info. "}

{"team": "thunder", "url": "https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/chris-paul-leadership-covid-200423", "date": "2020-04-23 00:00:00", "tags": ["Paul, Chris", "Thunder"], "article": " The NBA hasn\u2019t played any games in six weeks and for millions of fans around the world, it feels like planet Earth has stopped spinning without their basketball fix. But similar to the way everyone else wakes up each morning, gets dressed (or not) and finds a way to be productive from home or at their essential job, life hasn\u2019t completely stopped for the Thunder either. There are hypothetical games to be played in the future. Bodies need to be ready. NBA teams are living organisms that feed off of energy and connection. Team bonding still needs to happen. There are no more bus rides and long flights, no locker rooms or film rooms, but the Thunder has tried to adjust and control what it can during the social distancing that the NBA has encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading the Thunder players has been Chris Paul, and who else would it be? The President of the NBA Players\u2019 Association, the valedictorian of his high school, the former mentor in the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program is naturally inclined to take charge and point his teammates in the right direction. Just like office workers have traded in conference rooms for online Zoom calls, so has the Thunder. Paul has organized the digital video chats over the internet as a chance to touch base with everyone on the team, make sure that veterans can keep open lines of dialogue with the youngsters and ensure that each player keeps themselves in the best physical shape possible despite the adverse circumstances. \u201cWe just get a chance to call and talk and connect with each other and actually see one another,\u201d said Paul. \u201cNow, we have to figure out how to adapt and be better.\u201d In an inversion of a normal NBA season, players are getting ample time with their families but desperately missing their basketball brethren. There is an uncanny closeness to the 2019-20 Thunder squad, a team that had to reinvent itself on the fly with an influx of newcomers like Paul, Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, among others. After the team\u2019s identity was finally captured, the product was one of the best records in the entire NBA since Thanksgiving, a meteoric run over a three-and-a-half month span. That extended hot streak vaulted the Thunder to a 40-24 record and a dogfight to host a first round series in the Western Conference playoffs with 18 regular season games to go. No one knows what, if anything, remains in the future for this 2019-20 campaign, but Paul and his teammates relished every moment of this year\u2019s squad. \u201cThis has been one of the funnest years I\u2019ve had in the league, just with our team,\u201d said Paul, a 15-year veteran who has played for four different franchises and made the playoffs 11 times. \u201cI get excited with our Zoom calls because it makes me even more confident that we\u2019re going to find a way and get back to playing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot more time with each other than our actual families,\u201d Paul continued. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a team like we have where there\u2019s genuine happiness for each other, you always want to see what you can achieve.\u201d All of us humans, as we go about our daily \u2013 at times monotonous \u2013 routines, are staving off entropy, are resisting the temptation to cut corners, are watching out for any signs of slippage. Those are all factors for NBA clubs during a normal season too. Coaches and players made sure that they and their teammates maintained good habits during the dog days of January and must do so again now in our new atomized existence. \u201cThe biggest thing is as we talk as team, we talk about the mental aspect of it,\u201d Paul noted. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to talk and communicate with the guys as much as possible about competing with yourself during this time. That\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re trying to stay focused on.\u201d Each player, sequestered in their own unique homes or apartments, is having a different experience physically at this time. The Thunder training and support staff has done everything possible to get assets into players\u2019 hands for them to work out, lift weights, maintain their cardiovascular levels and even hone their jump shots, if they\u2019ve got the space. As many Thunder fans saw during the HORSE challenge on ESPN, Paul has an outdoor hoop in his backyard in southern California. Many players would be envious of that set up right about now, but even Paul is yearning to be back in an even more comfortable zone \u2013 a practice facility or indoor gym. \u201cThe last time I shot inside of a gym was layup lines against the Jazz,\u201d said Paul, referencing the Thunder\u2019s game on March 11 at Chesapeake Energy Arena that got postponed just seconds before tip-off. \u201cThis is the thing with having 450 players in the league,\u201d said Paul, donning his NBPA President hat for a moment. \u201cSome guys have access to a weight room. Some guys don't. Some guys have access to facilities where they can train, where they can run. You just never know.\u201d It\u2019s not just fans across the world who are anxiously anticipating some sort of decision about when they\u2019ll be able to see NBA basketball again. Players are feeling that way too. They\u2019re \u201citching to play\u201d as Paul said, but also know that there\u2019s no blueprint for what a return to action might look like. There have been creative solutions discussed but they will all have to check a variety of health and safety-related boxes on forms held by governments, health officials and NBA and NBPA executive leadership. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hypotheticals out there and it\u2019s great that people are brainstorming, and everybody wants us to get back to play. But safety of the players, the families, the fans, everyone, all that comes before any of it,\u201d Paul noted. Right now, everyone is looking for answers, but it seems that the questions are coming in even faster, like a rising tide invading a coastline. Sometimes, leadership doesn\u2019t mean having all the answers. Sometimes it means being able to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer, but I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d \u201cThis is such an interesting situation that we're all in,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThis is a situation where no one knows. The virus is actually in complete control.\u201d Thunder players are fortunate to have Chris Paul among their ranks, a leader to announce that type of honest, genuine perspective during this time. He\u2019s not presenting false hope nor is he pouting. He\u2019s staying vigilant, keeping his eyes up for information and ideas, and using his position of influence and leadership to keep his Thunder teammates informed, connected and inspired. Regardless of when the balls bounce again, that\u2019s valuable for the entire Thunder organization.  "}
{"team": "thunder", "url": "https://www.nba.com/thunder/strengthening-a-bond-together", "article": " A lot can happen in 25 years. Newborns develop into full-grown adults; once-barren Elm trees blossom into sprawling, deep-rooted landmarks; and quiet downtowns develop into bustling hives of activity and enterprise.   For the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum, two-and-a-half decades have witnessed that generational tide shift, the maturation of its own surviving American Elm and the renaissance of its city center, accelerated by the arrival of an NBA team in July 2008.  The global pandemic of 2020 has necessitated a very different remembrance effort for Sunday\u2019s 25th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. There can\u2019t be a live ceremony, but the Memorial has produced a television and online program to include 168 seconds of silence and the reading of the names of those who died that April morning. These changes do not dilute the message of remembrance and hope the Memorial provides.  For the Memorial, 2020 marks a significant year of value and progress, in part due to that team that arrived in 2008 and put its community at the forefront of its vision.   The Thunder\u2019s connection to its community is like the engine to a car. It\u2019s what drives hundreds of hours of player community engagement throughout the season, the force behind its loyalty to the Memorial, and the reason behind the design of the 2019-20 City Edition uniform that commemorates the 25th anniversary of April 19, 1995. Dan Mahoney has been the Thunder vice president of broadcasting and corporate communications since the team arrived in 2008\u2013\u2013a role that brings him into any conversation involving the Thunder and the Memorial. But for him, it\u2019s a personal, emotional subject, as his connection to the Murrah Bombing is unlike any other in the Thunder family.  On that sunny spring morning in 1995, Mahoney arrived at the Oklahoma State Capitol at his normal time of 8:30 a.m. He had a busy day planned as director of communications for Governor Frank Keating. When the blast occurred at 9:02 a.m., Mahoney was thrust into a role he never could have imagined when he began the job just two months before. Mahoney said he saw things that took an emotional toll on him, particularly with the loss of 19 children. His oldest daughter was four at the time, and his youngest had just turned one a week before. He had to balance that shock and emotion with the responsibility of working with Gov. Keating in a historic and important time of Oklahoma public service.   In the hours, days, weeks, months and even years following the tragedy, Mahoney assisted Gov. Keating and First Lady Cathy Keating on a broad array of issues related to the bombing. Whether it was helping to coordinate state media relations efforts during the rescue and recovery, helping with the healing prayer service organized by Mrs. Keating on April 23, 1995 or working with the Keatings to raise millions of dollars for college scholarships for children who lost parents that day, Mahoney found comfort through his role with the Governor.   \u201cThe Keatings led our state during that time with a blend of strength, vision and compassion,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cThey remain my lifelong dear friends and mentors.\u201d The other bright light for Mahoney during the dark days was having a firsthand view of the service, honor and kindness of Oklahomans in what has become known as the Oklahoma Standard. He first heard the term when a Virginia FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team member mentioned it to the Keatings as he was preparing to return home.  \u201cHe showed them his \u2018Oklahoma dollar,\u2019 the dollar he came with and was leaving with,\u201d Mahoney recalled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to spend it, everything was provided to him for free. He told the Governor, THAT is the Oklahoma Standard.\u201d  In his current role with the Thunder, Mahoney helps to spread that message on a global scale to a new generation of people, highlighted by a powerful message: out of evil, good can come.   In the years since the bombing, Mahoney also has witnessed a rebirth of the city.  \u201cThat tragedy could have brought Oklahoma City to its knees, but it didn\u2019t. The resilience of the city, and our people was inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Thunder is honored to be a part of this community and a component of the renaissance it has experienced. We also are proud to be able to help tell the story with the global reach of the Thunder and the NBA, to be able to bring that message to a new generation of people worldwide who can be inspired by it.\u201d  The community response to the Murrah Bombing is what has motivated Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti to make sure every player new to the city experiences the museum and its lessons. Before the players don Oklahoma City across their chest, it\u2019s critical to know who and what they\u2019re representing.  \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to realize that as much as it is recognizing the time elapsed, it\u2019s also a reminder to everybody that we all have a responsibility going forward to recognize and make sure that this stays top of mind for everybody in the community and the state that this is not something that can ever be forgotten,\u201d Presti said in December, when he joined the Thunder coaching staff to place holiday wreaths on each of the 168 chairs on the Memorial lawn. As the world continues to evolve with new generations of citizens and the ubiquitous presence of technology, Kari Watkins, executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum, and her team have to navigate the ever-changing times and how they teach individuals from eight years old to 80.   \u201cOne thing that\u2019s so important is understanding that we have to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cHow we told the story 25 years ago is not the same way we can tell the story today, not completely anyway.\u201d This is where the Thunder partnership with the Memorial has blossomed. As a global brand, with more than 14 million social followers and players known throughout the world, the Thunder has the ability to reach and educate a new audience by using its multigenerational, international platform.   Such was the case on the 20th anniversary of the bombing, when the Thunder helped launch the Memorial\u2019s #OKStandard campaign during a nationally televised game. Presti and team executives helped distribute blue wristbands to all those who entered Chesapeake Energy Arena that afternoon. The wristbands, with the words Service, Honor and Kindness in bold white letters, were worn by the fans, coaching staff and players on the floor in a total demonstration of unity. Now, five years later, it is fitting that the Thunder, working closely with the Memorial, would commit the design of its 2019-20 City Edition uniform to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the bombing.  \u201cIt was very clear in working with Nike to tell a story that mattered to Oklahoma and Oklahoma City that the 25th anniversary of the Murrah Bombing was the perfect story to tell,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cNot just the tragedy of what happened, but the tremendous response, the Oklahoma Standard, how Oklahoma was portrayed nationally and internationally for its response and its kindness and its Oklahoma Standard, but also to move this story forward.\u201d   Every detail of the uniform, from its distinct charcoal grey color scheme to the vents on the shorts to the Survivor Tree belt buckle, was weighed and carefully vetted to honor all those who were changed forever on April 19, 1995.   Watkins distinctly remembered the moment she presented the uniform to the Memorial\u2019s Conscience Committee, a group made up of families, survivors and first responders. Admittedly, she was a little nervous of what their reaction would be, but the response exceeded far beyond her expectations.    The thought that an NBA team would help keep their story alive 25 years later brought out a wave of emotions.   \u201cI\u2019ll never forget emailing (the Thunder) and saying, \u2018Guys, not only do they love it, but they\u2019re honored and touched that you would do this. It means so much to them,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Since that moment, the uniforms have spanned a national, global and multigenerational web of influence:   Nov. 5, 2019 \u2013 In a powerful on-court tribute before the game, one family member from each of the 168 victims killed in the bombing was presented with a custom City Edition jersey, the name of their loved one was stitched across the back and the number 95 appeared on the front and back. of the City Edition jerseys, which were given to the families of the bombing victims.   Eleven-year-old Kelton Arthur was one of the 168 to stand on the court. \u201cIt was just really emotional for me to see that my grandma (Dr. Peggy Clark) was getting recognized,\u201d he said in a wavering voice. \u201cThat\u2019s something really amazing happening in our city. \u2026 It just made me feel like (the Thunder) know exactly what happened that day and they can relate to what happened.\u201d Jan. 9, 2020 \u2013 The team wore the City Edition uniform for the first time. This was no ordinary game. Russell Westbrook was returning to Oklahoma City for the first time since requesting a trade to the Houston Rockets and the world was watching, with many learning more about the story of the Oklahoma City bombing and the city\u2019s resilience.  The charcoal jerseys swarmed the Rockets, 113-92.   \u201cIt was special for us. We all mentioned it before we got out there, \u2018We\u2019ve got to make everybody proud,\u2019 \u201d Thunder guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der said. \u201cIt\u2019s historic and we just tried to make the best game possible, go out there and compete for the people who were here when it happened. It was good for the city.\u201d   March 6, 2020 \u2013 It was First Responders Night at Madison Square Garden, a chance for both the New York Knicks and the Thunder to honor those who, 25 years ago, dropped everything, left their families and spent weeks serving the people of Oklahoma City.  Watkins exchanged jerseys with Alice Greenwald, president and CEO of the 9/11 Memorial, in a pregame ceremony that included Gov. Keating, his wife Cathy and Thunder legend Nick Collison, among others.    For the Memorial, its partnership with the Thunder has helped to drive the story of the bombing forward into a new era that consists of an entire generation was born after the horrible event.   \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership that\u2019s invaluable to us because it keeps our story relevant and in the minds of people who may not take the time to learn it otherwise,\u201d Watkins said. \u201c(The Thunder and the Memorial) are both unifiers to the community. They both bring people together. The Memorial is in the past, but we want to live in the future and the Thunder is about today and the future.\u201d The connection between the two has grown with each passing year. The Thunder has had a consistent, visible presence with the Memorial Marathon each year since 2009, from Presti handing out medals to runners at the finish line to Rumble serving as honorary chair-bison in the kids\u2019 fun run. In 2015, the Thunder staff divided into volunteer teams to amplify the Oklahoma Standard message across the metro. This year, the Thunder is providing free admission to the Memorial on the 25th day of each month.    \t \t \t \t \t \t \t To try to illustrate the breadth of the Thunder\u2019s reach, Watkins said she thinks about the time her own child was playing the popular video game, NBA 2K20. He was picking the uniform for his team when he yelled downstairs to his mom because he could choose the City Edition uniform as an option.   \u201cThat\u2019s teaching someone maybe somewhere who would\u2019ve never heard our story any other way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great impact from a jersey and pair of shorts that has tentacles that we may never understand how powerful they were.\u201d   Even before the uniforms, this was the Thunder goal from the beginning, to represent its beloved community with service, honor and kindness\u2013so that when fans across the globe see the Thunder play, they see the Oklahoma Standard. Not only out of respect and honor to those who experienced the unfathomable heartbreak of the day, but to educate the next generation on the valuable and timeless lesson learned by Oklahomans 25 years ago: out of evil, good can come.

Back-to-back possessions of elite defense in the final seconds sealed the fourth largest comeback for the Thunder this season after trailing by as many as 18 points. After a first quarter that ended with the Thunder up three points, OKC found itself down 18 mid-way through the second quarter after a dramatic shift in momentum. Up to that point, neither team settled into a rhythm offensively and it wasn\u2019t until the second quarter that a lead extended to double-digits. Boston rattled of five straight three pointers; Gordon Hayward dropped 10 points; and the Boston run extended to 19-4 to stretch the margin to 18.   By this point, the Thunder had plenty of reasons to lay down and let go of the rope. Down 18 on the road against a full-strength Boston team without its leading scorer in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for the first game this season.   But this is the Thunder \u2013 the same team who leads the league in clutch wins this season. The squad closed out the quarter on a 7-0 run punctuated by a Danilo Gallinari 3-pointer to bring the score to 52-63 tipping the scales enough to gain a slice of momentum going into the half.   \u201cWe just have a lot of fight, a lot of fight,\u201d said Thunder guard Chris Paul. \u201cIt just started getting away from us in the second quarter. We ended the second quarter on a little run and all season long we\u2019ve been winning these types of games\u2026We just never give up.\u201d   That fight continued into the second half. Chris Paul, the game-high leading scorer scored 14 of his 28 points in the third quarter. Taking advantage of Boston\u2019s switches, Paul navigated through ball screens sinking jumper after jumper in the midrange. Thunder comes out firing  to close the gap. pic.twitter.com/oQz31nb7db In addition to the offensive punch, the Thunder dug in its heels on defense. After allowing 10 3-pointers in the first half, Boston only sank three in the third quarter. Perimeter defenders pursued over ball screens making each shot as contested as possible and chasing them off the line. Rearview contests played a key role in this stat which is where Abdel Nader thrived on his way to a career-high four blocks.   \u201cThe ball was getting wherever it wanted to go and I thought we did a better job in the second half of handling the dribble at the point of attack,\u201d said Thunder head coach Billy Donovan.   After what seemed to be a deflating series of events consisting of three missed free throws from Schr\u00f6der and a missed break out layup from Nader, the Thunder rallied once again.  In the final play of the quarter it was Paul\u2019s defense that forced a missed shot by Boston with eight seconds to go. Paul snatched the rebound and pitched it ahead to Schr\u00f6der who was ahead of the pack and spotted up behind the 3-point line. Schr\u00f6der lined up the shot and knocked it down at the buzzer to bring the Celtics\u2019 lead down to one point and finally bring the game into control heading into the crunch time - a place that is common territory for the Thunder who leads the league in clutch scoring. Schr\u00f6der Alert  #6thMan A post shared by  Oklahoma City Thunder (@okcthunder) on Mar 8, 2020 at 5:03pm PDT The fourth quarter went back and forth for the entire 12 minutes. Big play after big play for each team set the stage for an unforgettable final minute of play. The Thunder trailed one point after a layup from Jayson Tatum with 40 seconds left in the game. On the other end, Steven Adams picked up a much-needed foul which sent him to the free throw line with 28 seconds to go. In the midst of a deafening Boston crowd, Adams missed both free throws, but Chris Paul swooped in and snagged the offensive rebound giving the Thunder a chance to take the lead. Paul put up a floater on the baseline that rattled off of the rim before the Thunder tipped it out of bounds in an attempt to grab the rebound.  Boston took the ball out on the sideline in the backcourt. Both Chris Paul and Dennis Schr\u00f6der stood ready to attack whoever caught the ball. The ball went in to Kemba Walker and immediately, he was swarmed by the two Thunder point guards. Schr\u00f6der tipped the ball free and ran it in for a layup to give the Thunder a lead with 8.5 seconds remaining.  \u201cWe wanted to get a trap before we fouled,\u201d noted Paul. \u201cSo, I just tried to cut Kemba (Walker) off, but, the presence of mind Dennis, who I trust wholeheartedly, he knew, so when we sent Kemba, he was right there.\u201d Nope that's our ball. #DennisSchr\u00f6der | #6thman pic.twitter.com/8wzuzEAZgs After Schr\u00f6der\u2019s layup, Boston immediately called a timeout to advance the ball and draw up a play. Meanwhile in the Thunder\u2019s huddle, Chris Paul was telling his coach that he wanted the matchup with Tatum.  \u201c\u2026I had a feeling they would go to him,\u201d Paul said postgame.  Sure enough, the ball ended up in Tatum\u2019s hands in the closing seconds. Paul was alone as Tatum tried to back him down to gain an advantage. The 13-year veteran didn\u2019t give an inch. He remained chest to chest with Tatum and only allowed one option for a shot: a tough, contested 2-pointer that fell short off the front of the rim. \u201cHe always does that,\u201d said Schr\u00f6der with a wide grin after the game. \u201cThe last possession, Chris always wants the best matchup\u2026Don\u2019t get it twisted, I do too but that\u2019s credit to him, he got the stop there.\u201d A major key to the Thunder\u2019s comeback came down to its performance in the third quarter. Boston rests as one of the best third quarter teams in the league with a +3.3 advantage in the third frame against its opponents. However, Paul\u2019s 14 third quarter points coupled with nine from Schr\u00f6der helped push the Thunder to a 10 point scoring differential in those crucial 12 minutes.

Everybody stepped up, especially some guys that hadn\u2019t played in a while. It was big for us.\u201d \u2013Abdel Nader  \u201cYou have to be willing to handle those kind of momentum swings, things not going your way, the difficulty and challenge and the adversity that goes on\u2026I think it speaks to the guys\u2019 character that they keep hanging in there and keep competing.\u201d \u2013Coach Donovan Abdel Nader with the media following the game.#ThunderUp pic.twitter.com/tJFaADgDoy After a three-game stretch on the road, the Thunder returns to Chesapeake Energy Arena for two matchups against Northwest Division foes.

{"team": "thunder", "url": "https://www.nba.com/thunder/features/headsup-200308", "article": " \"Make the smart play\" can often be lazily translated into \u201cmake the safe play.\u201d In the NBA, not taking chances avoids embarrassment but eschews bravery. The Thunder organization aims to never opt for the self-conscious side of that trade-off.  Aggressiveness and conviction, those are the prized qualities in decision-making.   With 13.8 seconds left on the road, the Thunder faced a choice. After a pair of missed free throws and a missed runner in the lane on the last of about a dozen emotionally-demoralizing sequences in the game, the Thunder found itself down by one point to the Boston Celtics. One of the NBA\u2019s best and most complete squads had the Thunder on the ropes and had the ball too.   Conventional wisdom has made it clear. In this situation, you foul as soon as the ball is inbounded. Extend the game. Give yourself a chance to get lucky later.   But the Thunder has savvy, moxie, grit. Togetherness and self-belief. As the Celtics in-bounded the ball to Kemba Walker, a four-time All-Star point guard, Chris Paul dug into a defensive stance, bending his 34-year-old knees and resisting Walker\u2019s inclination to get back to the middle of the floor. He walled him off, forcing Walker deeper into the backcourt. He didn\u2019t foul. That would have been the safe move.   Dennis Schr\u00f6der was guarding in the inbounds pass, but really his eyes were on Walker. Like an eagle waiting for the slightest flash of movement down below, Schr\u00f6der waited until Walker turned his back to protect the ball from Paul. In that moment, Walker couldn\u2019t see either of the Thunder\u2019s point guards.   \u201cI just tried to cut Kemba off. The presence of mind of Dennis, who I trust wholeheartedly, he knew,\u201d said Paul.   Springing into action, Schr\u00f6der purposefully but carefully darted towards Walker, staying low enough to trap. No sooner had the German lightning bolt arrived on the scene did the Thunder duo blow up Walker\u2019s handle. Nope that's our ball. #DennisSchr\u00f6der | #6thman pic.twitter.com/8wzuzEAZgs \u201cWe just wanted to get one trap,\u201d said Thunder Head Coach Billy Donovan. \u201cFigured that would be good enough.\u201d   The loose ball bounced just out of Walker\u2019s reach and right into a dribble for Schr\u00f6der, who scooped the ball up off the glass and into the basket with 8.5 seconds remaining, giving the Thunder a shocking 105-104 lead.   \u201cChris Paul kind of set it up and Dennis just went for the kill,\u201d said Thunder forward Abdel Nader, who had a career-high 4 blocks in the game. \u201cIt takes a leader like Chris to know exactly what to do in that situation, and a guy like Dennis to follow up.\u201d   In the NBA though, 8.5 seconds is an eternity, especially when a team can advance the ball into the frontcourt. Another decision needed to be made during Boston\u2019s timeout. It was a discussion point that needed addressing before the game even began, but the concern elevated to a higher level in crunch time.   Without the services of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder\u2019s 6-foot-6 guard, or Darius Bazley, a 6-foot-9 power forward, the Thunder was giving up a lot of height to Celtics forward Jayson Tatum throughout the evening. During the game, rookie two-way guard Lu Dort and third-year guard Terrance Ferguson did a masterful job at not giving Tatum anything easy. They absorbed his post ups, chased him around screens and got quick hands up into his face to contest his jump shots. The result was an inefficient 8-for-21 shooting night up to that point.   Still, everyone inside TD Garden, including the Thunder, knew that the ball was going to Tatum, the 21-year-old All-Star, on the Celtics\u2019 final possession. In the Thunder huddle throughout the year there\u2019s been banter about who gets the defensive assignment against the opposing team\u2019s best player. Ferguson and now Dort have shown they can get the job done. Schr\u00f6der always wants it. Same with Paul, who tonight asked Donovan in the huddle for the task.   \u201cHe always does that,\u201d Schr\u00f6der said with a wry smile, pretending to be annoyed. \u201cHe\u2019s 34 years old, still looking to compete. That\u2019s credit to him.\u201d   \u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted, I do it too. I told him, \u2018are you sure, you don\u2019t want me to get him?\u2019 Schr\u00f6der laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have that on the team.\u201d   Paul\u2019s voice carried the loudest this night, as Donovan gave him Tatum on the final possession. Understandable for that to be the case with a 10-time All-Star and 7-time All-Defensive First Team performer making the request. The safe move would have been using someone taller. The smart move was going with Paul.   \u201cI love that challenge,\u201d said Paul. \u201cIf he was going to win it, it was going to be on me.\u201d   As the Celtics inbounded the ball, Tatum started on the left block, then re-located over to the right block, ready to sit down in the post with Paul on his hip. The Thunder point guard was giving up about 8 inches in height to the Celtics forward, but defense is played with feet and thighs and abs and chests, not necessarily with long legs. Paul got up under Tatum, guiding him to make the catch not from 10 feet out where he started, but 20 feet away from the rim. In the NBA, that extra yardage makes a massive difference, but there was still work to be done.   \u201cI just wanted to make it tough on him,\u201d said Paul. \u201cAt this point in my career, I\u2019d rather guard a guy in the post than a guy out on the perimeter. You take me to the post, I\u2019m happy.\u201d   Tatum took two back-down dribbles but only moved about two feet closer to the bucket with Paul standing him up and challenging the dribble. Thanks to a Paul stab at the ball, the 6-foot-8 forward had to hesitate instead of continuing his momentum towards the rim. As Tatum gathered the ball, Paul swiped with the right hand in front as a distraction. As both players elevated as a fading 18-foot jump shot went up, Paul managed to sneak his left hand up into Tatum\u2019s sight-line, obscuring at least some portion of the hoop.   The shot caromed short off the rim. In the scramble, an array of Thunder hands knocked the ball around and the red light around the backboard went off and the final horn blared, and the clock hit zero. And there stood Paul. In the same spot 18 feet from the basket where he had forced Tatum\u2019s missed shot, pointing at the ground, at his turf. He might not be able to guard a guy like Tatum for 36 minutes, but for 8.5 seconds, when the game is on the line, that\u2019s Paul\u2019s spot.   A horde of sunset Thunder jerseys rushed over to their leader, with chest bumps and high-fives and the true appreciation teammates can only feel when they know that their team not only won the physical battle, but the mental one too. That's game. And @CP3 is . pic.twitter.com/P446kS1OrJ  "}

After putting the better part of his adult life on the line, Rob Newson - humbled by and grateful for a decorated military career - was prepared for a change of pace. \"I thought I had left that behind,\" he said. For more than three decades, Newson, who received a Bronze Star for acts of heroism, merit, and meritorious service in a combat zone, selflessly served his country. He is no stranger to crisis management, a skill honed on the front lines of battle, and while scheming up post-9/11 counter-terrorism campaigns. Late last year, however, Newson thought the timing was right to try his hand at something completely different: An executive leadership position for a professional sports franchise. \"It was just an opportunity I couldn't refuse,\" Newson said. So in January, Newson was appointed the 76ers' Vice President of Strategy and Vision. At a high level, his role was designed to oversee and manage the basketball operations department's leadership, culture, and innovation initiatives. \"It's really about being intentful about the right kind of culture that will support winning multiple championships.\" Listen to an interview with 76ers Vice President of Strategy and Vision Rob Newson on The BroadCast The original plan was for Newson to spend his first month with the Sixers getting to know his new surroundings and co-workers, then be up to speed in time for a busy homestretch. You can probably guess how the next part of this story goes. COVID-19 exploded, the NBA season was thrown into limbo, and immediately, there was a far more urgent batch of matters on Newson's plate. All of a sudden, he was back in the pit, attacking a global crisis head-on. The arena was unfamiliar and the opponent intangible, but the mindset was the same. \"There's muscle memory in the fire you've built up over managing a career of that, so it just clicks in. It was just so familiar and so natural to be in that spot.\" These days, under these remarkably trying, unprecedented circumstances, you'd think just about every person, business, or government even, could benefit from having someone like Rob Newson in their corner. His journey to the 76ers was paved through courage and dedication. And as he continues his transition to civilian life, Newson's commitment to serve remains steadfast and strong, same as it ever was. ********** Rob Newson admits that when he received a Naval ROTC scholarship to the University of Kansas in the mid-1980's, he wasn't thinking much about duty and service. He was simply looking for a ticket into school. \"Really, my motivation was I would pay for college, and I didn't want to ask my parents to help out too much,\" Newson said in a recent interview. \"The nation stepped forward and said, 'Sure, we'll pay for your college. In return, you spend four years in the military.' So that's kind of the path I started.\" At first, Newson was concerned. None of the options available in the Navy lit an immediate fire. Then, he discovered the SEALs. \"I was fortunate enough to get selected, go to SEAL training, and get through. That started one great assignment after another for almost 30 years.\" \"Great\" might be one way to describe the nature of Newson's work. \"Perilous\" is arguably another. He's been all over the world, starting out with deployments to places in the Pacific like Guam and the Philippines. In the aftermath of September 11th, he was sent to Bosnia, Kenya, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Somewhere between his first and second decade in the Navy, Newson realized his purpose, that he was called to serve. \"That was incredibly important to me,\" he said. \"The type of service changes from being in a front-line operational unit to being an operations guy that helps those guys, then moving up the leadership chain.\" During his tenure with the Navy, Newson gradually took on increased strategic duties. He was heavily involved in creating six military organizations from scratch, and was instrumental in developing processes that routed intelligence, promoted collaboration, and positioned complex issues across a variety of governmental entities. His final stop in the service was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As Director of the White House Military Office, Newson ran point on military logistics for Air Force One, Marine One, Camp David, the Presidential Food Service, and White House Medical Office. \"What an honor,\" said Newson. \"Every day I walked around there, I tried to remind myself that not too many people get to be on the inside of the White House, so you stop to take it all in. \"It's an amazing place - Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt - all of them walking around, they were standing right [there].\" For a while, Newson had his eyes on the National Security Council. Never did he see himself serving in the West Wing.  \"Just like the 76ers, there are opportunities that I dreamed not of that just kind of happened, and you've got to jump at it.\" Last year, as he was completing his PhD in Leadership Studies from the University of San Diego, Newson connected with the Sixers through The Honor Foundation, an institution that helps members of the United States' Special Operations Forces with various life transitions. \"These people have spent their entire careers in an elite force being the best that they can be,\" Newson said. \"It's both daunting and scary, and it's an unknown aspect to transition into civilian life. The Honor Foundation was designed to be that bridge.\" And that's precisely what the Honor Foundation did for Newson. Right away, he found common ground with Elton Brand. \"Immediately, our conversation revolved around leadership and culture, what culture is, and how you intentionally build culture. \"We clicked around those conversations. Elton's just a fascinating guy to get to meet and engage with.\" Newson went through rounds of interviews with Sixers' brass. He was left with a singular impression. \"I came away thinking this is a great organization, it's a great team of people who care about each other. That's what really drew me to the organization.\" ********* Earlier this month, as the COVID-19 outbreak was poised to peak, the faculty and residents of the Emergency Medicine Residency Program at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital met on Zoom, bracing for the storm to come. Not only is NewYork - Presby based in America's largest city, it's the largest hospital in the country, too. As of the writing of this story, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in NewYork City eclipsed 142,000. Healthcare workers and emergency personnel in the city have essentially been forced to adopt a wartime mindset, with minimal training to fall back upon. That's where leadership at NewYork - Presbyterian felt Rob Newson could lean in. He joined the ER Zoom call, aiming to inspire by sharing insights on bravery and service in the face of danger. He also spoke about the parallels between warriors on the traditional battlefield and in the medical field, telling the group: \"If you're an ER resident or a doc, you're a little left of center, like me. I have feared for my life, and I've worried over my family back home. I know what you are feeling. I've been where you are. 'I want to do this, I was made to do this, but I'd rather not die doing it.' So you see, we have a lot in common.\" Newson, whose wife is an emergency room doctor in San Diego, also stresses that the trickle down effects from the current race to contain and quash the coronavirus goes far beyond the nurses, doctors, and first-responder. There is an underlying fight underscoring all parts and walks of life. \"Everybody in the nation today is facing some kind of fight, right? There's unknowns around every corner. I think it applies to a lot of people on how you get through it, and how you maintain an attitude that is positive and focused on the right things instead of the negative aspect of what you're dealing with.\"  Through SEAL training, Newson learned there's little use in getting caught up in the chaos and confusion of crisis. He's been channeling the same mentality with the Sixers ever since COVID-19 began its rampant, indiscriminate, gruelling spread. \"It was non-stop crisis management for the first week or so, from what are we going to do taking care of people, who needs to be in self-quarantine, what was going to happen with work and coordination,\" Newson said. \"That turned into marathon on-line meeting sessions with different executives and different meetings. That lasted for two or three weeks.\" The more the Sixers' virtual workflow became routine, the more well-adjusted and efficient the front office became. \"Really, it's been fascinating to see the two main themes from the organization: how are we getting better, and are we ready?,\" said Newson. \"It's all been about taking this time to improve processes and product on the organization side, and then supporting the players so they can continue to stay in shape and prepare whenever or if the season starts up again.\" Whether that's in the next few months, or later this year, no one knows yet. But for Rob Newson, whose resolve and vision have been shaped by experiences to which few people can relate, this much is certain - he says he'll be happy to resume diving deeper into the world of pro sports. \"It's been such a treat to wear the nation's cloth and serve the nation. I'm grateful not only for that experience, but [a] skill set about teams, leadership, and culture. That was the foundation that I think brought me to the 76ers.\" "}

Billy Lange was an assistant under Brown for parts of Brown's first six seasons, before Lange, a native of Haddon Heights, NJ, was hired last spring to take the helm of the Saint Joseph's University Hawks. On the latest episode of TOM's Talks, Sixers radio announcer Tom McGinnis catches up with Lange, who reflects on his first season leading a Big 5 program, and the time he spent with his boyhood NBA team. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. Tom McGinnis: How would you describe your first season at Saint Joseph's? Billy Lange:\u00a0\"Of all the years I\u2019ve coached as a head coach and an assistant, this was one of the most rewarding in this facet - this was one of the most competitive, spirit-filled, engaged groups I\u2019ve ever been around from Day One until the end. These guys came to work. We might have had two bad practices all year. My experience with Brett in the first few years with the 76ers gave me a different lens on that type of process\u00a0 than I probably would have had if I didn\u2019t have that experience with the 76ers. We were able to keep the focus on the gain rather than the gap. We were able to step back and see the trajectory of the group and the program, and we were excited.\" TM: What's it like to run a program, and put into place all the things you've learned during your coaching career? BL:\u00a0 \"I\u2019ve had great mentors first, from Speedy Morris at La Salle, to Herb Magee to what is now Jefferson University, to Jay Wright, to Brett Brown, to my father, who I played for and grew up under going to his games, so I take a little bit of everything I\u2019ve learned from them. Then I\u2019ve had my own tenure as head coach, once in Division III, once at the Naval Academy, where I can harken back to successes and failures\u2026and then put all that together, and now it culminates in an opportunity to be a head coach in the Big 5 at Saint Joseph\u2019s. This is about as ready as I would have been for a position like this, and yet I still have so much more to grow, so I\u2019m excited for that as well.\" TM: You've been a lifelong Sixers fans. Seven years ago, you get to work for the team. What was that like? BL:\u00a0\"I could have stayed with the 76ers for the rest of my life. I loved being part of that organization, and I loved being in the NBA. I could have stayed in the NBA for the rest of my life. It\u2019s just truly an opportunity I had to be at a place in high regard is the only reason I was pulled from there. This just was epic for me. For me, being at Saint Joe\u2019s was a dream. \"The opportunity I had to be with the 76ers was a dream too, and in many ways it was perfect for the type of person I am. I actually enjoyed the Process part of it. It was painful to win 10 games, particularly when you\u2019re playing 82 of them. But the enjoyment of watching guys like Robert Covington and Jerami Grant and drawing and learning from guys like Brett, Lloyd Pierce, Mike D\u2019Antoni, Chad Iske, these were memories. True memories. \"To think I actually had an opportunity to coach this team when I stood in line to get a poster signed by Dr. J after they won the \u201983 championship, to just be some small part of the history of the Philadelphia 76ers is a blessing.\" Click the links below or search '76ers Podcast Network' to subscribe to our podcast feed wherever you listen to your podcasts.

{"team": "sixers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/ervings-iconic-career-commemorated", "date": "2020-04-19 00:00:00", "tags": ["76ers", "Julius Erving", "Dr. J", "Sixers History"], "article": " On April 19, 1988, 32 years ago to the date, the 76ers raised Julius Erving\u2019s no. 6 to the rafters of The Spectrum. Addressing the assembled crowd that night, Erving noted that winning the 1983 NBA title \u201cwas the highlight of my career as an NBA player and as a 76er. \u201cTime moves on, but memories last forever, and that\u2019s something that will be etched forever in the minds of basketball fans everywhere.\u201d Erving certainly made a lot of memories during his 16 seasons in the NBA and ABA, 11 of them with the Sixers. Along with the memories, Erving amassed a trove of honorifics. To name just a few: Four MVPs Three Championships 12 All-NBA/ABA Teams 16 All-Star Games He also racked up an enormous pile of statistics: 30,026 points 10,525 rebounds 5176 assists 2272 steals 1941 blocks The outpouring of love Dr. J received during his final NBA season\u2014even in cities like Los Angeles and Boston, home of his two fiercest NBA rivals\u2014signified that Erving\u2019s impact went beyond stats and championships.  The style with which Julius played the game inspired ambitious hoopsters around the country. By 1988, when Erving\u2019s career came to a close, those aspiring ballers had become NBA stars like Magic Johnson, Dominique Wilkins, and Michael Jordan, allof whom revered Erving as a living legend, not just an opponent. Spectators almost always left the arena satisfied that they had gotten much more than their money\u2019s worth thanks to Erving\u2019s swooping dunks. Fans at home were just as thrilled as they took to courts the next day trying to replicate (with varying degrees of success) the Doctor\u2019s you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it moves. Those 11 seasons as a Sixer, though, meant that the greatest outpouring of love and support for Erving was loudest and proudest in Philadelphia. Honoring Erving\u2019s final regular season game as a 76er, then-governor Robert Casey declared April 20, 1987 \u201cJulius Erving Day\u201d across the commonwealth. A year later on April 19, 1988, when the Sixers set about retiring Erving\u2019s jersey, the style was fittingly grand. Erving was just the fourth player in franchise history to have his number retired. The other three\u2014Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham and Bobby Jones\u2014were all on hand. Erving\u2019s old ABA coach Kevin Loughery was in attendance, as was NBA Commissioner David Stern. You know it\u2019s a big deal when the commish shows up for a jersey retirement. The Sixers also unveiled a statue in Erving's likeness, too. Saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. played the national anthem as only he could. Even the late Dave Zinkoff made an appearance as an archival recording rolled. Zink\u2019s unmistakable, hair-raising introduction for the Doc blasted through the arena: \u201cFrom Massachusetts, 6-6, No. 6, Julius Errrrrrrving!\u201d The festivities may have been extravagant, but you can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t unwarranted. Erving always represented Philly and the Sixers with magnificent style off the court. And with him in uniform on the court, the team had never been better. The franchise has had more than its fair share of outstanding players, but the 11 seasons with Erving are the best in franchise history \u2014 considering the height and breadth of the Sixers\u2019 success. We\u2019re talking an NBA title, four NBA Finals, seven Conference Finals, nine 50+ win seasons, and 11 playoff appearances. Erving would be the first to tell you he didn\u2019t do all of that by himself. He counted a collection of future Hall of Famers as teammates. However, it was Erving who unified these talents into a perennial contender, a dependable juggernaut and eventually a champion. Thus it\u2019s perfectly fitting that no other Sixer has ever worn No. 6.  "}

On this week\u2019s episode of TOM\u2019s Talks, Lynch joins Tom McGinnis to discuss his memories of his time with the Sixers, what he\u2019s learned in his career as a coach, plus his impressions of Shake Milton, whom he coached at SMU. Tom McGinnis: You talked about the 2000-01 team being built around Allen Iverson. You saw the incredible scoring performances, him playing through injuries. What was it like to be a teammate of Iverson's? George Lynch: \"I was more mesmerized on the things that he was able to do off the court. One night, we played the Spurs at the [Alamo] Dome, and they had the turf down on half the field. We were walking off, found a football, and we [started] throwing passes. \"They always talked about [Iverson] as a football player. He really did have a lot of talent on the football field. He probably could\u2019ve played in the NFL if he wanted to - if not some big time college football. \"And then was gifted at drawing. He could rap as an artist. And, he had a big heart. Him as a teammate off the court was more impressive than some of the other franchise players I\u2019ve been on [other teams with]. He did not want to miss a game. He played in every game possible, and he played one hundred percent.\" TM: You were one of [the Sixers'] designated defenders. That position - the three, the four - those are hard assignments. And at 6-foot-9, you might have been undersized in a lot of those matchups. What was it like guarding some of the best players in the NBA? GL: \"It was a great challenge. When you see your teammates like Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, Theo [Ratliff], [Dikembe] Mutombo, Tyrone Hill - no one was really griping about the assignments that we had, it was just a team effort. We all played within our strengths and weaknesses, which allowed Allen to be Allen. We knew Allen was going to take the majority of the shots, so we didn\u2019t really have to expend too much energy on that end, so we had a lot to give on the defensive end.\" TM: What did you see in Shake Milton [when Lynch coached him at SMU], and what do you see now? GL: \"Shake can definitely score. The more he played, he had that smooth, \u2018I\u2019m not going to rush, you\u2019re not going to speed me up.\u2019 He had long arms, he had a vision that none of the other guys [had]. He showed the skillset and the basketball IQ for a high-level NBA player.

{"team": "thunder", "url": "https://www.nba.com/thunder/features/two-cities-one-unbreakable-bond", "article": " Oklahoma City and New York City don\u2019t have much in common. As a matter of fact, outside of their three-letter identifiers, the two cities couldn\u2019t be more different. But when an Oklahoma City police officer stood face-to-face with a New York firefighter by the south pool of the 9/11 memorial, the two embraced and talked like old friends. One spoke with a noticeable southern drawl while the other had a thick Long Island accent. On the surface, it seemed as though the two merely shared a vocational connection; but at the core, they were bonded in a deep brotherhood created by a common tragedy nearly 25 years before. It was a powerful reunion of brothers that would\u2019ve been easily overlooked by a casual bystander.   However, when the Thunder wore its City Edition uniforms made in partnership with the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum in front of the crowd in Madison Square Garden on March 6th, it uncovered the rich and powerful history that unites them and helped share it with the world.   That history involved two tragic events, two cities, nine first responders and one handmade rosary. Thanks @nyknicks. Truly a memorable night. pic.twitter.com/tZpzthDcQP Governor Frank Keating had only been in office for three months when tragedy struck in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. As the news of the bombing began to flood in, Governor Keating received a call from Washington \u00ad\u2013 it was President Clinton. He wanted to know what happened and what he needed to do to help. Keating was unsure of what exactly happened, but knew one thing was for sure, they needed reinforcements.   \u201cI don\u2019t know who did it or what happened, but we need help because the OKC fire department and the police department were just shy of 1,000 people each, maybe 900, and he said \u2018we\u2019re on it, we\u2019re going to get the urban search and rescue teams from all over the country\u2019 and one of the teams mercifully for us was Ray Downey\u2019s team from New York.\u201d   Back in New York City, a former marine turned Fire Department chief named Raymond Downey helped to create and grow New York Task Force 1 (NY-TF 1) which is New York City\u2019s Urban Search and Rescue Team \u2013 a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The team responded to everything from fires to natural disasters. This special operations unit was trained to handle any and every call of danger it received.   Downey was one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on rescue operations at collapsed buildings and more importantly, he was a valiant, humble leader among first responders in New York City. Around the country, Downey was known as the godfather of technical rescue and to other firefighters, he was virtually invincible.   \u201cHe was a very, very good firefighter, one of the best we ever had here in New York City. He was also a leader at the national level for Urban Search and Rescue\u2026he was the national representative for all 28 teams and sort of the godfather of technical rescue in the country. For us, he was just dad,\u201d said Joe Downey, son of Ray Downey who now works in his father\u2019s position as FDNY battalion chief and leader of Task Force 1 working out of the same firehouse on Roosevelt Island in New York City that his father did. Joe is the oldest of five Downey children including Chuck Downey who also serves as chief in the FDNY. At home, Ray hardly talked about his work, everything he experienced in the field was put to the side to be present with his family.   \u201cHe was a great father, a good supporter to our family, a loving dad and didn\u2019t talk about what he did on this job too much,\u201d said Joe Downey.   But when Ray was called to respond to the Oklahoma City bombing in April of 1995, Joe saw something different in his father.   For 16 days, Ray Downey\u2019s team helped to uncover the 168 people who lost their lives in the attack including 19 children which ultimately had an unfathomable impact on Downey who had just began his new role as a grandfather. When Governor Keating realized the toll the work was taking on his visitors from New York, he paid a special visit to the bombing site in downtown Oklahoma City to see Chief Downey and pass along a token of comfort.   Prior to that visit, the governor received a small package in the mail from a group of nuns in Bavaria who made hand-crafted rosaries made of a cloth-like material. Keating decided to keep one for himself and give the other one to Downey who he thought might need it after seeing the magnitude of casualties caused by the bombing.   Upon seeing Ray standing on the pile, Keating called out, \u201cHey Ray, are you a Catholic?\u201d   Ray quipped back, \u201cIs the Pope a Catholic?\u201d Which sent both into a much-needed burst of laughter. It was then that the governor handed over the rosary to Ray for him to have as he continued in his arduous mission. Rather than keeping the rosary in his pocket like one would typically do, Ray wore it around his neck and under his shirt every single day from that point on.   \u201cIt had a huge, profound impact on him \u2026 and I\u2019m just happy I had something from those nuns in Bavaria to give him because it meant a lot to him for the rest of his life,\u201d said Keating.   Ray and his team returned back to New York after over two weeks of toil through downtown Oklahoma City. When Joe and his mom greeted Ray at the airport, Joe noticed something different about his father.   \u201cWhen we went to pick him up from the airport, he looked totally exhausted. He had no voice, it was tough to talk, and you could see that something was bothering him. I think what he saw in Oklahoma had an impact on his life and he was a strong, strong man,\u201d said Joe. Six years and five months later, the date was Tuesday, September 11th, 2001. It was a beautiful day in New York with a clear blue sky and not a cloud in site. Downey received another call to respond to a collapsed building. This time, the call came from his hometown of New York City.    While thousands of people flooded from the horrific scene, Ray ran straight toward the cloud of smoke ordering people out of the tower and directing them to safety. When the second tower fell, it took the life of Ray along with eight other task force members who spent 16 days working with Ray in Oklahoma City six years before.   \u201cHe had the opportunity to leave, and the members that went to Oklahoma City, some of them probably had the opportunity to say maybe this is getting too dangerous and I should get out of here, but they didn\u2019t because that was their job,\u201d said Joe.    The same courage and bravery illustrated in response to the Oklahoma City bombing exemplified itself in those first responders who put their life on the line to save others in New York. Along with that deep-rooted emotional connection that crossed state lines, Ray still had in his possession a physical link to OKC with him on the day that he died \u2013 the handmade rosary made by a group of nuns in Bavaria given to him by Governor Keating.    \u201cIt\u2019s just a mentality of a first responder. You don\u2019t think about the danger half the time,\u201d said Joe Downey. \u201cThis is our job, we signed on to be on this job and we respond.\u201d Nearly 25 years following the Oklahoma City bombing and 19 years after the attack on the World Trade Center, both Oklahoma City and New York City have recovered, but not forgotten. In OKC, the people developed a shared code of conduct that became known as the Oklahoma Standard. In New York City, the people came together across all walks of life, unified by a common loss.   It was because of this bond that the Thunder circled the Knicks matchup on its calendar. When March 6th rolled around, the team wore its renowned City Edition jerseys honoring all those who were killed, those who survived and those changed forever on April 19th, 1995. In Madison Square Garden, the evening\u2019s theme was First Responders Night. The color guard was comprised of members of both the FDNY and NYPD. Holding the American flag was a joint contingent of both Oklahoma City first responders and those who went to Oklahoma City from New York to aid in the bombing recovery effort. The group also included family members of the police and fire heroes who worked Oklahoma City and died in the line of duty on 9/11.   What the audience didn\u2019t know was that the day before, the entire group paid a visit to the 9/11 memorial and museum. The fire and police personnel from OKC had the opportunity to reunite with their brothers and sisters in service while also seeing the names of the nine Task Force members who served in Oklahoma City in 1995 and lost their lives in the attack on 9/11. It was this emotion that radiated throughout the arena on March 6th. For the players on the floor, the sight carried significant weight.    \u201cIt was a huge surprise,\u201d said Thunder guard Chris Paul. \u201cSo, when we heard that announcement, I think everybody on our team sort of felt even more emotional response. Those jerseys mean a lot to us in Oklahoma City, but to have our first responders from Oklahoma along with those from here in New York I think was pretty special.\u201d   \u201cI think it\u2019s great just for Oklahoma City to be acknowledged and obviously the people here in New York City,\u201d said Thunder head coach Billy Donovan who like Joe Downey is a native of Long Island. \u201cBoth cities went through devastating circumstances, 9/11 and then obviously the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. I think for two cities to come together and to take a moment of silence and to reflect on how great both of those cities are in Madison Square Garden was a great tribute to New York City and Oklahoma City.\u201d It was an opportunity for the two teams to share their story with the world. A story that was only known among the memorial staff and community of first responders. To the average person, Oklahoma City and New York City are hardly ever spoken in the same sentence. On Friday night, the Thunder and the Knicks partnered to educate the world on that sacred connection which brought the two cities together.   Standing at center court of MSG were president and CEO of the 9/11 memorial Alice Greenwald and executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum Kari Watkins. The two held jerseys from their respective cities. Watkins held the distinct Thunder City Edition jersey while Greenwald clutched the Knicks Association uniform before swapping in a sign of mutual respect and solidarity. The memorial representatives were flanked by Keating and his wife Cathy, Knicks great John Starks and Thunder alum Nick Collison.   \u201cThe fraternity and the fraternal affection and goodwill that existed and will continue to exist between the fire service and the police in New York City and Oklahoma City is really a beautiful thing,\u201d said Keating. \u201cI think the jerseys memorialize brotherhood and sisterhood and goodwill among and between people.\u201d   Now, in addition to the handmade rosary from Bavaria, the symbolism of the deep connection between the two cities is made tangible by a charcoal grey Nike uniform worn by NBA players in the world\u2019s most famous arena on basketball\u2019s biggest stage.    \u201cThe city obviously went through a tremendous tragedy 25 years ago and I think everybody\u2019s connected to that and understands how impacted everybody was and it\u2019s great to see how the city has pulled together and you hope in some way basketball is a way to help bridge that gap and keep people connected,\u201d said Donovan.

But the NBA\u2019s hiatus isn\u2019t the most pressing concern right now. \u201cThe reality is, at this point in time, it\u2019s not about sports, it\u2019s not about basketball,\u201d Rosas said during Tuesday\u2019s virtual media availability. \u201cIt\u2019s about individuals and their safety and getting back to a place where this pandemic is controlled, and that\u2019s going to take some time and we\u2019re cognizant of that. We have to be on top of it on our end.\u201d No one has a perfect manual of how to handle the pandemic that continues to sweep the world, but the Timberwolves \u2014 with help from Vice President of Basketball Performance and Technology Dr. Robby Sikka \u2014 have attempted to be as proactive about COVID-19 as possible. \u201cNobody can be fully prepared, nobody has all the information, but Robby and his group did an incredible job of making sure that we were cognizant of our situations, knowing anyway that we could support our players, our staff, their families, and our community. It\u2019s taken a life of its own.\u201d The team was preparing for a 12-day road trip prior to the season\u2019s suspension and prepared their players for playing in empty arenas or delaying the trip all together. \u201cAt that point in time, our focus was on educating our players and giving them the opportunity to prepare their families for whatever may come,\u201d Rosas said. Even in times of constant chaos and daily changes, the Timberwolves\u2019 transparency, support and guidance for their players has not wavered. With their various trade deadline roster moves, the young Wolves were still trying to solidify their new normal even before the pandemic erupted. Players were adjusting to playing and being with each other on a daily basis, getting accustomed to Minnesota and trying to create new lives as Timberwolves. An unforeseen chasm has obstructed that process, but Rosas, Saunders and the entire Timberwolves front office and coaching staff is trying to ease their players\u2019 transitions as much as possible. They, of course, can\u2019t physically be with their players right now, but Rosas and Saunders have gone out of their way to let their players know they\u2019re supporting them from afar during this time of uncertainty. The team has implemented virtual daily check-ins, positional meetings, individual film sessions, motivational speakers, food delivery, mental health check-ins and have even tried to move some players into houses that hold basketball courts. They\u2019ve done all this while also being cognizant of the fact that players also need more time to check in with family members around the nation and globe. \"More than anything, we want to make sure that players feel supported,\" Saunders said. \"Basketball is important to all of us, but family, health and getting through this together is the most important thing right now.\" -\u00a0Katie Davidson The phrase \u201cthe new normal\u201d probably has you annoyed right now. The truth of the matter is that there\u2019s really no such thing as normal during a pandemic. The Timberwolves are doing the best they can to make things as normal as possible, even though they aren\u2019t able to see players or staff in-person. Timberwolves President of Basketball Operations Gersson Rosas estimates that 65 or 70 percent of the team is in the Twin Cities area. Throughout this all, the Timberwolves have set up food programs, installed workout equipment and even helped move players into houses that have a basketball court. There have been daily check-ins with players from the front office, training staff and coaching staff. This has also included conversations with the team\u2019s psychologist to ensure that each player\u2019s mental health is strong. \u201cWe want to give players who are isolated right now a little more normalcy and part of that is seeing the people you\u2019re with on a day-to-day basis, seeing your teammates and having those social interactions and being able to engage in a basketball arena and have that type of conversation,\u201d Timberwolves head coach Ryan Saunders said. The Timberwolves didn\u2019t necessarily predict the pandemic was coming, but they were prepared for it. Led by Sikka, the team put together a program prior to the NBA stoppage \u201cjust in case\u201d. The Timberwolves were certainly prepared for something like this, but even still, everyone is kind of learning on the run. \u201cThere\u2019s no manual for this,\u201d Rosas said. Sikka has been leading the way as far as research and best practices go, while the team has also worked closely with Andy Slavitt, the former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicare services under President Barack Obama. \u201cEvery step of the way, we\u2019ve tried to be educated, making the best decisions we can,\u201d Rosas said. While most would certainly view this a giant obstacle, Rosas is doing his best to stay positive and use this as an opportunity to get to know the players better on a personal level. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t be together on the court, we can\u2019t be together as an organization with our players, what we can do is get to know them better as people. \u201cWe have individuals that as humans we want to make sure we can meet their most basic needs and help them feel positive, supported and that they\u2019re not alone going through this process so for us, it\u2019s something that we preach about family, we preach about being player-centric, these are the types of opportunities that allow you to make it a touchpoint.\u201d\u00a0- Kyle Ratke COVID-19 has hit the Timberwolves family close to home. On Mar. 25, Karl-Anthony Towns released a video urging everyone to take coronavirus seriously. Towns\u2019 mom, Jacqueline Cruz,\u00a0was put in a medically induced coma fighting coronavirus in late-March. There are no updates to give out of respect to the Towns family. It\u2019s worth noting that prior to this, Towns donated $100,000 to Mayo Clinic for COVID-19 vaccine research. Saunders has certainly had multiple conversations with his star center, but he\u2019s keeping those conversations private. \u201cI\u2019ll just say that his strength and the strength he\u2019s shown for his teammates and just for being able to share is not just admirable,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s something he should be commended for the way he was able to bring more attention to safe practices.\u201d Our thoughts and prayers are with the Towns family in what is a truly scary time. Rosas was later asked about Towns\u2019 wrist injury and made it known quickly that there are bigger things to worry about right now. \u201cOut of respect for KAT and what he and his family are going through, we\u2019re not going to comment on his wrist or any player\u2019s injury,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cWe want to be respectful of those individuals as they deal with things that are very personally important. At the proper time, we\u2019ll address that accordingly.\u201d -\u00a0Kyle Ratke On Monday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the league wouldn\u2019t be able to consider a potential return to play before May 1. Rosas reiterated that there is not enough information to solidify a timeline for a return at this time but was able to share that\u00a0everyone\u00a0wants to play. \u201cBut first and foremost, we have to be safe and healthy and make sure that we\u2019re not putting our players, we\u2019re not putting our staff, we\u2019re not putting our fans and public in danger,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cI have to give the league a lot of credit. They\u2019re looking at every and any avenue to continue this season.\u201d The league has of course considered extending the season out into the summer and coincidingly pushing pack the 2020-21 season. This move would also of course impact 2020 Summer League and the upcoming draft if enacted. \u201cThose are all critical points in time for the team-building process, the development process,\u201d Rosas said, commenting on how Summer League and the draft could be affected. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already begun to look at depending on when the season ends, depending on when the draft ends, how can we develop our young players? What can we put together in order to simulate what Summer League does for our players?\u201d But the reality remains that there are too many unknowns to map out a blueprint at this point. \u201cThe more guidance that we get health-wise and as our world, country and our league gets more structure, I think we\u2019ll be very creative,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cI think this gives us an opportunity to do things we haven\u2019t done in the NBA in the past. Adam Silver deserves a lot of credit for that in that there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunities for us to restructure ourselves in a way that may be more beneficial down the road. Now there\u2019s a real urgency to do it. \u201cWe have to continue to be patient, be smart. It\u2019s been great to see how the league has united, how teams around have united. We all are working toward the same thing.\u201d -\u00a0Katie Davidson "}

The American flag was unfurled just before the Star-Spangled Banner was performed, and as the announcement of the color guard was made by the public address announcer inside Madison Square Garden, Thunder Chris Paul felt a wave of emotion come over him.  First responders from Oklahoma City and New York City who had been on the scene at both the 1995 Murrah Building bombing and the 9/11 attacks were joined together in a moment of solidarity and mutual respect. Paul and his teammates took off their warmup jerseys to reveal the team\u2019s 2019-20 City Edition jerseys that honor the 25th Anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, marking the first occasion the Thunder has worn them on the road this season. Thanks @nyknicks. Truly a memorable night. pic.twitter.com/tZpzthDcQP \u201cWhen we heard that announcement, I think everybody on our team felt an even more emotional response,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThose jerseys mean a lot to us in Oklahoma City and to have first responders from Oklahoma along with those here from New York, I think that was pretty special.\u201d  Once game-play began, the Thunder\u2019s defense was tested in a completely different way than it is on most nights but that didn\u2019t stop OKC from routing New York to the tune of 126-103. The Knicks went just 4-of-24 from the three-point line for the game, missing its first 9 threes before finally hitting its first triple midway through the third quarter. Instead, the Knicks were deadest on attacking the paint at every opportunity.  They routinely set their screens lower than most NBA offenses, down below the three-point line. That allowed Knicks guards like Elfrid Payton and rookie RJ Barrett to sneak their way into the lane, and big men like Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Taj Gibson to fill up space in the paint for layups or second chances. The Knicks hung close with the Thunder and scored 36 points in the paint in the first half.  That pushed the Thunder to be even better in its help side defense, to pull across at the right time when they trapped Randle or Bobby Portis on the wing. In the second half and particularly during a late third quarter stretch, the Thunder did that to great effect, putting together multiple stops in a row.  \u201cWe just felt like we had to show a crowd the best we could and we were going to live with trying to get out to contest threes. We did both fairly well,\u201d Head Coach Billy Donovan said.   In the meantime, the Thunder\u2019s offense just kept on humming along. In a span of 50 seconds, Chris Paul found Danilo Gallinari for a pair of three-pointers, one coming on a behind-the-back pass, that the Italian sharpshooter and former Knick drained with ease. The buckets put the Thunder up by 20, a welcome payoff after inching its lead up from 7 after one quarter to 13 at halftime. Can't hold him back. @gallinari8888 leads all scorers with 22 points at the end of Q3. pic.twitter.com/D0I63PTj3R \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been doing since the beginning and something that in crucial moments we always go for,\u201d said Gallinari. \u201cI was just reading the defense.\u201d  That connection between Paul and Gallinari has been there all season and tonight it boosted the Thunder\u2019s stretch forward to a game-high 22 points on 7-of-13 shooting. For the season, Paul has assisted on 57 of Gallinari\u2019s 163 total three-pointers (34.9 percent), good for the second-most of any duo in the NBA.  \u201cMe and Gallo just talk about pace and setting screens,\u201d said Paul. \u201cWhen he sets screens and they switch, he takes it to the post. Or when two people guard me, you find him.\u201d  \u201cI get mad when Gallo misses,\u201d Paul smirked. \u201cI get really mad, because he\u2019s not supposed to. When you throw it back to him and nobody\u2019s there, you can just go the other way.\" The Thunder had built a substantial lead, but NBA fans know that games are never truly out of reach if there\u2019s still 12 minutes left to play. OKC ensured there\u2019d be no chance at a comeback though with its emphatic start to the fourth quarter. What started as a 13-0 run right out of the gates resulted in a 22-5 surge over the first six minutes of the fourth quarter, edging the Thunder\u2019s lead up to 34 points.  The spurt was punctuated by a pair of ferocious dunks by Queens, NY native Hamidou Diallo, who stepped in to play 26 minutes and rack up a season-high-tying 12 points. Bursting into the rotation after Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was nabbed for a couple early fouls, Diallo brought the energy in his hometown by attacking the glass, cutting hard and punishing the rim. He flushed one dunk on a pass from Adams then another from Paul for the point guard\u2019s 12th assist, tying a season-high.br&gt; Can someone check on the rim? A post shared by  Oklahoma City Thunder (@okcthunder) on Mar 6, 2020 at 6:47pm PST \u201c(Diallo) finding those spots, those slashes, those dives, those quick cuts to the basket, we need that from him,\u201d said Donovan. Paul\u2019s passing set up the play of the game as well, which occurred in the second quarter on a beautiful sequence of backdoor cuts. Paul drove towards the right wing, bouncing a pass to Gilgeous-Alexander who darted down the baseline towards the hoop. As a help defender crashed over, rookie two-way guard Lu Dort sliced into the lane from the left wing for one of the easiest Thunder baskets of the night. \u201cWhen there\u2019s pressure being placed at the rim or somebody driving, they\u2019re going to pull over. You\u2019ve gotta try to find areas on the weak side to make some cuts and create an open gap for the next guy to pass to,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cOur guys on the backside got into some open areas and gaps where we could make some plays.\u201d   Due to New York\u2019s aggressive help-side defense, the Thunder was able to punish some overzealousness by playing heads up, team basketball. Hitting cutters right on time and on target was the reason OKC notched 26 assists for the game. While piling up the assists, the Thunder managed to have one of its very best nights protecting the ball in team history. With a total of just four turnovers, OKC tied a season-best from January 20 at San Antonio. The team\u2019s lowest ever turnover figure was back on March 5, 2013, when the Thunder had just two against the Los Angeles Lakers.  Paul was in complete control of the offensive flow, which always helps keep turnovers down, but he also had help as Gilgeous-Alexander, Gallinari and others did a nice job of attacking while maintaining control and making the simple play when it was required. \u201cI keep telling the guys we only have basically 20 more auditions before the playoffs. We gotta start building the right habits and making sure we\u2019re getting ready for the stretch run.\u201d \u2013Chris Paul  \u201cWe put together some stops and were kind of able build on the lead. Guys did a nice job of closing the third and starting the fourth. We played well on both ends..\u201d \u2013Billy Donovan The Thunder will aim to sweep this three-game east coast road swing with the final contest coming against the Celtics in Boston on Sunday evening. The Thunder will have a chance to hit 40 wins on the season and go to 16 games above .500, which would be the high-water mark for OKC this season.

Here are a few excerpts.  Tom McGinnis: What was it like playing with Iverson and traveling with Iverson? Todd MacCulloch: \u201cI always had a Discman, back in the day, pre-iPod, and I always had music to listen to, but never wanted to because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Iverson Show. I didn\u2019t want to miss the jokes he was cracking, and just how entertaining he was. I remember people would talk about him hanging out at T.G.I. Friday\u2019s when I first got to Philly, and I thought, \u2018Friday\u2019s must be some happening club.' I found out, it's a T.G.I. Fridays, and it was near the practice facility. So I went there with my Winnipeg friends, maybe a month or two into the season. Iverson is there with his friends in the corner. I\u2019m still a little nervous and starstruck, even though we\u2019re teammates - he\u2019s just a larger than life personality, and people want to be around him, and I was no different. I said, \u2019Allen, I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but will you take a second here and maybe sign an autograph for my friends? And maybe take a picture?\u2019 He was like, \u2018Yeah, sure! I\u2019ll take a picture with your friends, and I\u2019ll sign, but who are you?\u2019 And I go, \u2018What?!\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I gotcha man! Don\u2019t be so gullible.\u2019 He was making fun of me in front of my friends, and I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s not funny Allen.\u2019 He was cool.\u201d TM: You went to the NBA Finals with the Sixers in 2001. What was it like to play on the league\u2019s biggest stage? TM: \u201cThat was a dream come true to make it to the NBA Finals. I hadn\u2019t played much leading up to that Finals series\u2026 I just wanted to do the best I could. I thought, \u2018Shaq is better than me in every way, but I\u2019m going to try hard. I\u2019m going to try to beat him down the floor. I\u2019m going to try to give that extra effort, and if and when he blocks me, I\u2019m going to try and get it, and I\u2019m going to try to go right back up with it.\u2019 I just had an attitude of just trying to play within myself, do the things that I do, and try to do them as best I could. Winning Game 1 was a huge thrill, and I think surprised a lot of people.\u201d TM: What are your impressions of your fellow Washington Husky, Sixer rookie Matisse Thybulle? TM: \u201cI haven\u2019t met Matisse, but I already love the guy. I know people that know him, and they\u2019ve spoken extremely highly of him. I loved watching him play, and he just had this quiet intensity to just get it done. He never quit, on any play, ever. So when I heard that Philadelphia drafted him, I was thrilled. I knew that you guys would fall in love with him. I knew how hard he worked, and how much the fans would appreciate that effort. I had heard from people what a great guy he was, and how much people would like him personally. So I thought that was a great fit, and I was happy that the Sixers got such a great teammate. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that people really like the way he plays. He has incredible instincts, and you combine those instincts and those gifts with effort, and it makes for quite a difficult player to score on.\" Click the links below or search '76ers Podcast Network' to subscribe to our podcast feed wherever you listen to your podcasts.

With this feature, Story Behind the Shot, we wanted to take a blended approach. Check out the links a little farther down below for previous installments in the series. We hope you enjoy! STORY BEHIND THE SHOT Shake Milton On his March 1st performance against the LA Clippers \"Your number gets called, you see an opportunity. That\u2019s what you put all the work in for. That\u2019s why you\u2019re staying locked in - for that opportunity. You just try to make the most of it.\"  Alex Subers 76ers Photographer \"Every game has multiple storylines, whether it\u2019s a match up between two players, a player visiting a former team, emerging young talent, guys stepping up in the absence of other players, etc. \u201cAs a photographer, you go into every game with storylines in the back of your head - matchups between players, a player returning to face an old team, things like that. Then, you try to keep an eye out for images or moments that capture these storylines. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m always shooting where the ball is when the game is going on, I tend to lean towards the storyline and shoot extra photos of whatever that may be. The above photo of Shake is an example of that approach. \u201cWith some key players out of the lineup during the west coast trip, I knew that a big theme would be other guys needing to step up, and that focusing on those players would be key. It became pretty clear from the start of the Clippers game that Shake was cooking, and he would most likely be the story of the game, no matter the outcome. \u201cI took this shot right after Shake stole the ball from Patrick Beverly, and threw down a pretty mean dunk that a lot of people probably weren\u2019t expecting. Because the Shake storyline was in the back of my head, I kept the camera on him for seconds after the dunk, and was able to get the photo of his reaction, which I think sums up his 39-point performance in LA.\" Past Entries: Week of 2/13 - 2/20: Two Guys That Keep Things Moving Week of 1/24 - 1/31: Important Enough to Pause Weeks of 1/13 - 1/22: It's Cool to Have a Mentor Week of 1/17 - 1/12: Blessed to Play This Game Week of 12/31 - 1/6: A Better Purpose Week of 12/23 - 12/30: Making it Rain Week of 12/14 - 12/22: A Quiet Purpose "}

Why not Furk?\u201d In his third season in the NBA, Furkan Korkmaz has emerged as a key part of the 76ers\u2019 rotation. He\u2019s been impressive, dependable, and, at times, sensational. Just over a week after his coach teased growing\u00a0 a \"bomber,\u201d Korkmaz hit a memorable game-winner in Portland. pic.twitter.com/f52lsN1tp3 \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) November 3, 2019 Over the next five months, Korkmaz put together his breakout season, highlighted by back-to-back 30-plus point performances in February. With all the furkan jerky tonight. pic.twitter.com/qGqadM8l1t \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) February 8, 2020 Korkmaz has become exactly what Brown was searching for in October.   In an interview conducted last month for the latest installment of Studio 76's Here They Come behind-the-scenes video series, the Istanbul, Turkey native reflected on his decision to answer that call: \u201cI met with Coach Brett Brown, and we had a long meeting. He was straight up to me. He said, 'If you just make threes, and play defense, you will be on the court... It\u2019s up to you to get the minutes.'\u201d Shortly after that conversation, Korkmaz heard what Brown had said in his postgame press conference that followed the Sixers' opening night win over Boston. \u201cI need to grow a bomber.\u201d \u201cWhy am I not that guy?\u201d Korkmaz said. \u201cI accepted the challenge.\u201d Accepting that challenge proved to be exactly what the 22-year-old needed - validating his steps along the unlikely path he\u2019d taken in the months prior. Entering last summer as a free agent, Korkmaz was facing an uncertain future. He was pleasantly surprised by the Sixers' offer to bring him back, and excited to return to familiar territory.  While he was originally drafted 26th overall by the 76ers in 2016, Korkmaz already had years of pro ball under his belt before landing in the NBA. He played in his native Turkey, and for the Turkish national team. That time playing on the international stage would prove formative. \u201cI played a lot of games with the national team. There were a lot of crucial moments, crucial shots which I made, and which I missed,\u201d Korkmaz said. That spirit has shown itself throughout the Sixers\u2019 2019-20 campaign, from Korkmaz' games as a steady contributor, to others with game-winning moments. \u201cI\u2019m not really afraid of the moment because at the end of the day, someone needs to take the shots, or someone needs to make the decision.\u201d  Prior to the NBA going on hiatus, Korkmaz was averaging a career-high 9.6 points per game, while shooting a career-high 39.3% from long range and a career-high 42.8% from the field. Not bad for a guy who, less than 10 months ago, wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d be back in Philadelphia.  \u201cI\u2019m really happy this year. I\u2019m really proud to be here after a couple hard years for me,\u201d Korkmaz said. \u201cWhen you start to play better basketball, that gives you more confidence, and makes you happy.\u201d And he's excited for the opportunities to come. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good a player you were at 16, 18 years old - it really matters how good you are right now,\u201d Korkmaz said. And while the fate of the season remains uncertain, Korkmaz remains thankful to be part of something special. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about what happened in the past,\u201d Korkmaz said. \u201cI learned from [the past], and I want to keep moving forward. I\u2019m really proud to be part of this organization, this team.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say the team is proud to have him too.  "}

Prior to the league suspending play, Studio 76 had been working on a feature about the 27-year old, and the tight-knit nature of his family. Here's the story of how Pelle's signing was made that much more surreal, thanks to a heartwarming plot twist. ********** Norvel Pelle and his family talk. A lot. Like, a lot a lot. How much is \"a lot?\" \"Every day, \" says the 76ers' big man. When it comes to his immediate family, Pelle is always on the phone - calling or texting. It could be his mother, Darlene; his father, also named Norvel; or one of his three sisters. Bring up the topic of family with the 27-year old Pelle, and you get the sense it's as much a part of his identity as the sport he's turned into a profession. So imagine then, for a moment, the following scenario: It's the day you're signing your first, full-time NBA contract. You've played out the scene in your head countless times, and in each instance, Mom and Dad are right there with you. But here's the rub. Mom and Dad live three time zones away. Everything's happening fast. There's no way they can make it across the country in time for the big moment. Bummer. On Feb. 7, Pelle made his way to the 76ers Training Complex. He got his normal treatment for about half an hour, then it was time to make his deal official. As Pelle rounded the corner from the training area to the first-floor conference room where he was going to ink the pact, he did a double-take. Could it be? No\u2026 Was that really...Mom and Dad? How?!?! As sure as Pelle's contract was laying on the table, yes, Darlene and Norvel Pelle were standing right there in the conference room, waiting to celebrate with their son. It was hard for Pelle to contain his happiness.  \"I almost cried bro. I literally almost cried.\" The surprise was befitting of the bigger story. Pelle was always considered a longshot. He wasn't supposed to be there, in that room, sitting side-by-side with Elton Brand, who was offering Pelle an NBA contract. But there Pelle was, and - to his absolute shock - so too were two of the most important, supportive people in his life. The script was perfect. ********** About 1,300 miles off the southern tip of Florida, close to where the Carribean Sea flows into the Atlantic Ocean, are the islands of Antigua and Barbuda. Norvel Pelle was born there, in the capital city of St. John's, in 1993. When he was seven, Pelle and his family moved to Los Angeles. A few years later, he picked up basketball. At the time, his fanbase might not have been big, but it was damn sure loyal. \"When I used to play, my mom would be the loudest one in the whole stands,\" Pelle recalled, a nostalgic fondness oozing from his voice. Mom would stand and cheer. Dad would cheese. \"I could hear her over everybody,\" said Pelle. By the time Pelle reached high school, he was already considered one of the best prospects in the country, ranked among the top 25 by Rivals, top 40 by 247sports, and top 100 by ESPN. A feature on Pelle in the Los Angeles Times once described him as a \"knockdown mid-range shooter\" who got the nickname \"Gazelle\" because he could \"run the court more nimbly than players a foot shorter.\" When his high school career ended, Pelle went straight to the pros. The organization that gave him his first shot? The 76ers. Pelle was chosen sixth overall in the 2013 NBA G League (then 'D League') Draft, becoming the first-ever pick in Delaware 87ers (now Blue Coats) history. He averaged 5.5 points and 3.1 rebounds in 13.1 minutes per game that season, then spent parts of the next four years overseas, bouncing between Lebanon and Italy. During his off-seasons, Pelle landed a couple summer league gigs - with Miami in 2016 and 2017, before reuniting with the Sixers as part of their 2018 summer squad. He turned enough heads in Las Vegas that year to earn an invite to Sixers training camp in the fall, which eventually led to another shot in the G League with Delaware. Pelle averaged 14.1 points and 9.4 rebounds in 2018-19, en route to G League All-Defensive First-Team honors. After another solid summer league stint with the Sixers in 2019, Pelle signed a two-way contract. He shuttled back and forth between the 76ers and the Blue Coats for the first month of the current season. Right before Thanksgiving, he went on a tear in Delaware, and erupted for 51 points, 35 rebounds, and nine blocks in the span of three games. Pelle subsequently made his NBA debut a few days later at Madison Square Garden, turning aside four shots in 12 minutes against the Knicks. He even started a game Dec. 15 at Brooklyn. \"I started in the D League a few years ago, it was the 87ers, then just traveled across the world and came back last year,\" said Pelle. \"I did what I had to do, and now I'm sitting here in the Sixers' locker room, which is crazy.\" In the aftermath of his promotion, Pelle was doing more than just holding his own. He was having a productive, inspired impact.  \"Norvel has explosive athleticism and has proven that he can be an elite rim protector,\" said Brand, the 76ers' General Manager. \"He adds valuable depth to our front court.\" Which became more and more apparent the more Pelle played. Once the Sixers' moves at the February trade deadline were official, a roster spot had opened up. Brand filled it by signing Pelle to a standard NBA contract. \"I'm excited for Norvel,\" Brand said. \"He's worked really hard to get to this point, and is well-respected throughout our organization. We're all really happy for him.\" Pelle described his journey up to this point as \"hectic\" and \"humbling.\" \"Every moment, every second I've been appreciating it,\" he said. \"This year is just like a dream come true. I'm just taking it all in.\" But seeing his parents at the 76ers Training Complex when he showed up to sign his first NBA deal, that was almost too much to be believed. ********** Not only does Norvel Pelle talk constantly with his mom, dad, and three sisters by phone, the family also has an active group chat. Whether by voice or by text, rarely do these conversations revolve around Pelle's profession. \"It's more taking me away from the whole life of a basketball player,\" he said. But when his signing was imminent, it was impossible for Pelle not to bring up hoops. The full-time NBA contract he had long been striving for was finally at his fingertips, and he was proud to share the news.  Long before it was even a remote reality that Pelle would become a full-time NBA player, he often told the people closest to him that his wish was to have his parents by his side whenever and wherever he signed. \"We knew that if this was ever going to happen, we wanted to bring his parents in,\" said Tod Seidel, who\u2019s been Pelle's agent since his second pro campaign. It was an idea that Seidel and Dwyane Thompson, one of Pelle's first cousins, had been talking about for \"a couple years.\" Pelle would drop his own hints, too. \"He expressed deep interest in definitely wanting his parents to be there for the signing, if he ever got the opportunity,\" said Thompson, whose father is brothers with Pelle's dad. \"If nothing else, he wanted his parents to watch him sign because this was the process of making his dream come true.\"  So, after Pelle finally broke the news about his impending signing to his family over text, Seidel and Thompson helped Darlene and the elder Norvel Pelle catch a red eye from LAX to Philadelphia. They landed around 6:30 in the morning, about four hours before Pelle was due to put his name on the dotted line. To pass the time, Seidel, who grew up in Villanova, actually set the Pelles up at his own parents' place so they could catch their breath and grab some grub. Then, it was off to the 76ers Training Complex, where the Pelles were ushered through the proverbial back door. \"11 o'clock came, and boom, they were standing right there, man,\" said Pelle. He was stunned. \"I was happy, and then my parents were there, and that put the icing on the cake. It was just like, 'Oh man, wow.'\" It may have been a lot for Pelle to absorb, but everything that was happening was real. \"Surreal,\" Pelle said. \"It's crazy.\" The Pelle family will forever have that moment - together - as it seemed like it was always destined to be.

{"team": "sixers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/two-franchises-bound-philadelphia-hall-famers", "date": "2020-03-07 00:00:00", "tags": ["76ers", "Sixers History"], "article": " Wilt Chamberlain and Alex Hannum are two of the greatest figures in 76ers history. Their union as player and coach in 1966-67 produced the franchise\u2019s first title in Philadelphia, and was perhaps the best team in NBA history. Chamberlain\u2019s achievements are well known, but Hannum deserves credit for helping unlock the most devastating version of Wilt possible. Hannum enjoyed an eight-year playing career in the NBA\u2014including two seasons with the Syracuse Nationals\u2014before beginning a Hall of Fame coaching career in 1956-57. But for our story here, we\u2019re zooming in on Hannum\u2019s coaching in the 1960's because that\u2019s when he and Wilt made their hoops connection. Here\u2019s a handy timeline of Hannum\u2019s coaching stops in this period: \u25cf\u00a0  Syracuse Nationals: 1960-63 \u25cf\u00a0  San Francisco Warriors: 1963-66 \u25cf\u00a0  Philadelphia 76ers: 1966-68 FIRST IMPRESSIONS  In Hannum's first season as Nats coach, his club ran into Chamberlain\u2019s Philadelphia Warriors in the playoffs. The Big Dipper ran wild in the series with 37.0 points and 23.0 rebounds per game, but Hannum\u2019s Nationals swept Philadelphia 3-0. The secret sauce for Hannum was a belief in egalitarian scoring and movement on offense. During the regular season, Syracuse had six players average between 13.0 and 24.0 points. The trend kept up in the playoffs, with eight players contributing between eight and 24.0 points. For the 1961-62 season, the Nationals and Warriors again met in the playoffs. This time, Wilt\u2019s Warriors won the series, 3-2. The Nats did well considering their leading man Hal Greer was injured for the series. Chamberlain put an exclamation point on the series with 56 points and 35 rebounds in the decisive Game 5. Now this is where the story gets tricky. So carefully wrap your mind around the following: \u25cf\u00a0  The Warriors moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in the summer of 1962 \u25cf\u00a0  The Nationals moved from Syracuse to Philadelphia - becoming the 76ers - in the summer of 1963. \u25cf\u00a0  Hannum was hired as San Francisco Warriors coach in August 1963 This meant that for the 1963-64 season, the basketball world would see how Hannum\u2019s views meshed with the single greatest scorer in league history. GAME CHANGE During his first four seasons, Wilt averaged 42.9 points, 26.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game. However, Hannum\u2019s prodding had an impact on the Big Dipper. Chamberlain\u2019s scoring average fell to \u201cjust\u201d 36.9 points while his assists jumped up to 5.0 per game for the 1964 season, as he actively worked to involve teammates in the offense. Just as important, Hannum\u2014a former Marine\u2014hit the right note of both respecting and seeking his star\u2019s opinion, but not letting the star player disrupt the team\u2019s needs. Hannum was there to coach, not dictate or be dictated to. Chamberlain respected his new coach\u2019s approach immensely. Here Wilt recalls his first season playing under Hannum: \u201cI was still scoring a lot\u2014I had over 50\u00a0 ten times that season\u2014but Alex had us moving more and looking for the open man, and he helped me in developing my passing ability, as well as my scoring ability. Because I\u2019d always been so big and strong, coaches hadn\u2019t figured it was necessary for me to work on finesse and some of the subtle fundamentals necessary to be a good passer. I guess they thought scoring and rebounding was enough of a burden for me. Not Alex. He wanted me to do it all, and he was the first coach who really encouraged me to work on my passing in practice and use it during the game.\u201d  Accordingly, the Warriors\u2019 record bounced from a subpar 31 wins in 1963 to 48 victories in 1964. Reaching the NBA Finals, the Warriors were outclassed\u2014as most clubs were in this era\u2014by the Celtics in five games. Hannum\u2019s vision and Wilt\u2019s implementation of it carried the Warriors far, but it all fell to pieces in 1964-65. The central problem was Chamberlain having a puzzling health scare over the summer that kept him hospitalized for nearly a month. As Chamberlain remembered, \u201cI had three regular doctors\u2014Dr. Good News, Dr. Bad News and Dr. No News. Dr. Good News kept telling me I\u2019d be out water skiing in a week. Dr. Bad News would tell me I might never play basketball again. Dr. No News just walked around the room shaking his head.\u201d After weeks of thinking he had a major heart issue, Wilt was finally diagnosed with pancreatitis. Still, the ordeal had led to considerable weight loss and Chamberlain missed the entire exhibition slate and the first five games of the regular season. San Francisco never regained the flow of the previous season, and entered the 1965 All-Star break a miserable 11-33. Frustrated and suffering financial losses, Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli traded Chamberlain (and his large contract) to the 76ers in February 1965, temporarily breaking up the Hannum-Chamberlain connection. Nonetheless, Wilt retained his Hannum lessons. He was named league MVP for the 1966 season as he averaged 33.5 points, 24.6 rebounds, and 5.2 assists. Yet, the Celtics again beat the Sixers 4-1 in the East Finals. As for Hannum, the Warriors\u2019 future looked bright thanks to Nate Thurmond taking over at center for Chamberlain and rookie scoring sensation Rick Barry. But he had a falling out with Mieuli after the 1966 season and was dismissed as coach. Fortunately, the Sixers just happened to have a coaching vacancy at that very moment too... REUNITED Hannum was brought in as coach of the Sixers for the 1966-67 season. Wilt and he were hungry for an NBA title. Chamberlain had never won the championship and Hannum hadn\u2019t done so since his St. Louis Hawks defeated Boston in 1958. As Wilt easily won another MVP award, hjis assists surged to 7.8 per game in the 1966-67 season. He still managed a healthy 24.1 points on a record-setting 68.3% shooting from the field. Wilt\u2019s passing was even more effective, given the Sixers roster at his disposal. Hannum had previously coached Greer, Larry Costello, and Chet Walker during his stint with Syracuse. So, those three Sixers were used to Alex\u2019s methods. Newcomers Billy Cunningham, Wali Jones, and Luke Jackson got the idea pretty well too. With their powers combined, the Sixers ran out to an absurd 68-13 record and pounded Boston 4-1 in the East Finals ending their dynastic reign. Once again in the NBA Finals, Hannum and Wilt poetically faced off against the San Francisco Warriors in six hard-fought games. Opening the series in Philadelphia, Game 1 went to overtime when the Warriors rallied from a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Wilt (16 pts, 33 reb) and Thurmond (24 pts, 31 reb) were in a vicious battle down low, while Barry went off for 37 points. Luckily, Chamberlain also added 10 assists helping fuel four Sixers with 20+ points on the night: Greer (32), Jones (30), Cunningham (26), and Walker (23). The Sixers survived, 141-135, in overtime. Game 2 was a rout as the Sixers drubbed San Francisco, 126-95. The Big Dipper kept up with Hannum\u2019s advice as he added another triple-double: 10 points, 38 rebounds, and 10 assists. Game 3 in California was a close match throughout. Barry finished with 55 points on 48 shots. Thurmond muscled his way to 17 points and 25 rebounds as the Warriors claimed a 130-124 victory. The Sixers\u2019 defense recalibrated in Game 4 and forced the opponent into 35% shooting on the night. Chamberlain had a near-triple-double with 10 points, 27 rebounds, and eight assists, as the Sixers won 122-108 to take a 3-1 series lead. Game 5 was back in Philly, but the team missed a chance to seal the title at home. The Warriors unleashed a torrential 33-13 edge in the fourth quarter to steal Game 5, 117-109, thus forcing a Game 6. With the series and championship on the line, Chamberlain went to work scoring 24 points (8-13 fg, 8-16 ft). The free throw tally looks\u2014and frankly is\u2014bad at first glance. However, during the other five games of the series, Wilt shot a stunning 25% from the charity stripe. Thus, the unexpected hot streak from Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, as the Sixers won by just three points, 125-122, and secured the NBA title.  The victory for the Hannum and Wilt was redemption and vindication. Hannum could prove his 1958 title over the Celtics wasn\u2019t some fluke. Chamberlain could at long last put to rest the idea he wasn\u2019t a team player. Of course, he too would win another title with the 1972 Los Angeles Lakers. Three decades later the connection was still undeniable. When Hannum was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1998, he called Wilt up asking if he\u2019d be Hannum\u2019s presenter. Wilt happily accepted, telling his old coach, \u201cI\u2019m proud to be your sponsor.\u201d Follow @SixersHistory on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Instagram. "}

Fueron siempre por detr\u00e1s en el marcador, pero en un final igualado todo puede ocurrir y la suerte no sonri\u00f3 a Philadelphia. Brett Brown comentaba al final del juego que: \"Cuando dejas que te metan casi 60 puntos en la pintura es muy dif\u00edcil ganar\". Tambi\u00e9n hay que reconocer, que a pesar de ir casi todo el encuentro por delante en el marcador, los Sixers no pudieron poner tierra de por medio en ning\u00fan momento y los Warriors supieron estar siempre cerca para aprovechar su oportunidad en el momento justo. De nada sirvi\u00f3 la gran actuaci\u00f3n de Tobias Harrris que volvi\u00f3 a lograr superar la veintena de puntos. En 35 minutos en pista logr\u00f3 anotar 24 puntos en un 10-23 en tiros de campo, con un 1-5 en triples y 3-3 en tiros libres. Sum\u00f3 4 rebotes y 4 asistencias una buena actuaci\u00f3n, que no sirvi\u00f3 para obtener el triunfo final. Otro jugador que tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 superar la veintena de puntos fue Al Horford, que parece haber recuperado el buen todo de juego. Con 36 minutos en pista, termin\u00f3 con 22 puntos con un 9-16 en tiros de campo (9-16 en tiros de campo), sumando adem\u00e1s 10 rebotes y 7 asistencias. Otra vez m\u00e1s se qued\u00f3 muy cerca del triple-doble, sin lograrlo, pero logrando de nuevo una gran actuaci\u00f3n el dominicano. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, Shake Milton estuvo 29 minutos en pista, que aprovech\u00f3 para lograr un 5-10 en tiros de campo y 3-4 en tiros libres para sumar un total de 14 puntos, a los que sum\u00f3 3 rebotes y 3 asistencias, para cuajar una nueva buena actuaci\u00f3n, y consolid\u00e1ndose como una de las esperanzas de los Sixers, de cara a los playoffs. Los otros tres jugadores de los Sixers que superaron la decena de puntos anotados, vinieron del banquillo de Brett Brown. 15 puntos logr\u00f3 Glen Robinson III, con un magn\u00edfico 4-5 en tiros de de campo, 2-2 en triples y 5-5 en tiros libres, sumando adem\u00e1s 6 rebotes y 3 asistencias en 28 minutos en pista. Por su parte, 11 puntos lograron tanto Raul Neto (19 minutos en pista, con un 3-4 en tiros de campo y 3 asistencias), como Alec Burks (4-8 en tiros de campo, 4 rebotes y 2 asistencias en 18 minutos en pista). Una dura derrota, ante un equipo que tiene la cabeza en el draft 2020 y en la pr\u00f3xima temporada. Ahora solo queda pensar en el siguiente juego, que har\u00e1 que nos veamos las caras con los Pistons de Detroit, esta vez en el Sur de Philadelphia, por lo que hay motivos de optimismo y de pensar que podremos sumar un nuevo triunfo a nuestro casillero de victorias. Hasta pronto desde Espa\u00f1a. @Sixers_Espanol "}

At Tuesday\u2019s practice, the Sixers welcomed a couple familiar faces back into the fold, as Joel Embiid and Josh Richardson returned to the court. While Embiid remains questionable (shoulder) for Wednesday\u2019s matchup, Richardson (concussion) is available. \u201cI thought just watching them move, and be with the team, and be part of that newness in some areas, in itself was fantastic,\u201d Brett Brown said after practice.

We need both of those guys,\u201d said Horford, who finished with 18 points, eight rebounds, and six assists against the Kings, then posted 22 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists against the Warriors. Shorthanded in California, the Sixers agreed that the trip brought positive takeaways. Shake Milton had a breakout week, filling in for Ben Simmons (back).

Tobias Harris led the Sixers with 24 points (10-23 fg), while also adding four rebounds and four assists. Al Horford had a solid showing as well, with 22 points (9-16 fg, 2-5 3fg), 10 boards, and seven assists. In a competitive, scrappy battle between two shorthanded teams, Golden State used a 10-5 run late in the fourth quarter to tie the score, 106-106. Harris put the Sixers back in front with a tough, driving lay-up, but the Warriors held the Sixers without a point for the final 90 seconds.  The loss resulted in the Sixers and Golden State splitting their two-game season series. The Sixers finished their trek out West with a 1-3 record. Click here for a complete box score. TURNING POINT Saturday's game never really felt like it was out of Sixers' control until it was too late. After a Tobias Harris triple nudged the Sixers in front, 114-113, Villanova product Eric Paschall sunk a pair of free throws to flip the score back in Golden State's favor, 115-114. Then, following a pivotal stop by the Warriors' defense, Golden State got to the line two more times to secure its victory. WORTH NOTING \u2022 The Sixers were outscored 36-24 in Saturday's decisive fourth period. \u2022 While the Sixers committed just four more turnovers than Golden State (11 / 7), the Warriors outscored the Sixers, 18-9, on turnover possessions. \u2022 The Sixers acquired Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III at the February trade deadline, and the two former Warriors fared well for themselves in their return to the bay. Burks contributed 11 points (4-8 fg), four rebounds, and two assists. Robinson III tallied a bench-best 15 points (4-5 fg, 2-2 3fg).  \u2022 Stephen Curry (illness) and Draymond Green (left knee) were both held out of Saturday's game.

Following a 125-108 win in Sacramento on Thursday, the Sixers will look to even up the road trip before heading home to Philadelphia to play four straight. When the Sixers and Warriors (14-49) last met on Jan. 28 -- a 115-104 Sixer victory -- both teams looked notably different. For one, current Sixers Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III were still Warriors themselves in that matchup, later joining the Sixers at the trade deadline. Burks and Robinson\u2019s first meeting with their former team comes after impressive performances from both players on the Sixers\u2019 West Coast swing. Sunday against the Clippers, Burks tallied 15 points (bench high), six rebounds, and three assists. He led the bench once again Thursday, finishing with 17 points, three rebounds, and a pair of steals. Robinson led the Sixers in scoring Tuesday against the Lakers, tying his career-high with 25 points and four rebounds. As both players prepare to meet their former team for the first time, the Warriors will look different too - notably adding six-time All-Star Steph Curry back into the fold, after Curry missed the majority of the season with a broken hand. Curry returned to competitive play Thursday against the Raptors, and finished with 23 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists in his return. Still shorthanded, without Joel Embiid (shoulder), Ben Simmons (back), and Josh Richardson (concussion), the Sixers will turn to the rest of their roster once again. It\u2019s been an impressive road trip for Tobias Harris, who notched a 28-point, 14-rebound double-double Thursday in Sacramento. He added 25 points against the Clippers and 18 against the Lakers. In his last four games, Harris has hit 48.2% of his shots from long range and 53.4% of his shots from the field. Filling in for Simmons, Shake Milton has scored at least 19 points in four of his last five outings, including a massive 39-point performance Sunday against the Clippers. Mike Scott has also had a strong showing out West, scoring in double-digits and grabbing at least six boards in all three of the Sixers\u2019 games thus far. Saturday\u2019s contest tips at 8:30 p.m. ET. Opponent Outlook: It\u2019s been a season of change for the Warriors, who played the majority of their season in the absence of Curry and with the addition of D\u2019Angelo Russell. Russell was traded to the Timberwolves at the trade deadline, when Andrew Wiggins joined the Warriors. Wiggins has averaged 20.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.6 blocks per game this season. Former Villanova Wildcat Eric Paschall has been a standout rookie for the dubs, averaging 13.8 points and 4.7 rebounds per game. Follow Along: Watch: ABC Listen: 97.5 The Fanatic "}

Un juego que no tuvo demasiadas alternativas, con un primer cuarto igualado, pero con un resto de partido en donde Philadelphia logr\u00f3 estar siempre por delante. Lo cierto es que la victoria en Sacramento era necesaria, sobre todo por recuperar buenas sensaciones, tras las lesiones de Ben Simmons y Joel Embiid, que dejaron a los Sixers un poco hu\u00e9rfanos de superestrellas, pero con la buena noticia del paso adelante que han dado tanto Tobias Harris, como Shake Milton, que volvieron a tener una muy acertada actuaci\u00f3n en el norte de California. Suyas fueron las dos mejores actuaciones de jugadores de los Sixers ante los Kings y junto con Al Horford, guiaron al equipo de Brett Brown hacia una nuevo triunfo, que es muy importante para el equipo. Las ventajas de los Sixers en el segundo, tercer y cuarto periodo no le hicieron pasar apuros en el juego, quiz\u00e1s tan solo un momento de incertidumbre con el 106-112 a falta de 4:58 para el final del partido, que oblig\u00f3 a los Sixers a concentrarse en la recta final del encuentro, para que no se escapase la victoria. El equipo respondi\u00f3 y con un parcial de 13-2 en esos \u00faltimos cinco minutos hizo que pas\u00e1ramos del 106-112, al 108-125 final. Dos fueron los jugadores de los Sixers que lograron alcanzar la veintena de puntos, siendo Harris y Milton los grandes protagonistas del juego, al liderar a los Sixers en esta importante victoria. Tobias Harris acab\u00f3 el juego con 28 puntos anotados, gracias a un 11-22 en tiros de campo en 37 minutos en pista. Logr\u00f3 un 4-6 en triples, adem\u00e1s de sumar 14 rebotes y repartir 3 asistencias. Buenos n\u00fameros para Harris, que se vio bien secundado por Milton. Y es que Shake Milton tambi\u00e9n alcanz\u00f3 la veintena de puntos, gracias al 8-14 en tiros de campo, obteniendo un 3-5 en triples, en los 27 minutos que estuvo en pista. Todo ello para sumar 20 puntos, adem\u00e1s de a\u00f1adir 3 rebotes y 3 asistencias a su brillante estad\u00edstica. Otro jugador que destac\u00f3 con una brillante actuaci\u00f3n fue Al Horford, que se reivindic\u00f3 en Sacramento, al terminar en juego con 36 minutos en pista, sumando 18 puntos en un 7-14 en tiros de campo, y sumar adem\u00e1s 8 rebotes y 6 asistencias, logrando de nuevo una actuaci\u00f3n que le acerc\u00f3 al triple-doble. El otro jugador del quinteto titular que logr\u00f3 sumar dobles d\u00edgitos en anotaci\u00f3n fue Mike Scott, que logr\u00f3 sumar 11 puntos en 25 minutos en pista, gracias a un 5-10 en tiros de campo. No fueron los \u00fanicos jugadores con dobles d\u00edgitos en anotaci\u00f3n para los hombres de Brett Brown, ya que los dos mejores jugadores del banquillo de los Sixers tambi\u00e9n sumaron muchas unidades, para hacer que el banquillo aportase a la victoria ante los Kings. Alec Burks acab\u00f3 el juego con 19 minutos en pista y 17 puntos anotados, con un 6-12 en tiros de campo (3-6 en triples), mientras que Raul Neto (21 minutos en pista) acab\u00f3 con 16 puntos anotados, con un 5-8 en tiros de campo (2-3 en triples).

Robinson\u2019s output tied a career high. His line also included three 3-pointers (his first threes in this tenure as a Sixer), four rebounds, an assist, and a steal in 31 minutes. \u201cIt was always going to be a difficult game. But my criteria is did we get something out of it, did we move the needle a little bit? And I believe that we did,\u201d Brett Brown said postgame. \u201cI think to get something out of Glenn Robinson was big tonight.\u201d Robinson was traded to the Sixers from the Warriors alongside Alec Burks (12 pts, 4 reb). His standout performance came in just his tenth game this season as a Sixer. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what he did,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe needed it all. When you search for silver linings, I believe that this could be one.\u201d It\u2019s been a breakout season for Robinson, who has averaged 12.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.6 assists (all career-highs) across his time with the Warriors and Sixers. As the Sixers have battled injuries throughout Robinson\u2019s stint in Philadelphia, the fifth-year wing says it\u2019s all about learning and growing. \u201cI continue to believe in myself, and went out there and gave it my all,\u201d Robinson said. Robinson also expressed his appreciation for Burks as a friend and resource. \u201cMe and AB, our goal is to help this team win, and we were brought here to help this team win. So we\u2019ve got to continue to figure out ways to do that,\u201d Robinson said. After scoring 19 points, seven rebounds, and two assists against the Lakers, Tobias Harris gave Robinson III props. \u201cI thought [Glenn] did great. He came out with a great energy. The ball found him in different spots. He was really active today, and that was great to see.\u201d As their road trip continues, the Sixers will visit the Kings Thursday and the Warriors Saturday. Robinson feels this time on the road together will contribute to its ultimate success: \u201cThis trip is important, even off the court - shootarounds, practices. We spend more time together on the road, getting to know each other, creating that chemistry.

Postgame, Milton sent the praise right back: \u201cIt was a great team effort. Tobias and Al stepped up big, they were huge for us, being the leaders that they are,\u201d Milton said. Harris had another strong outing, setting the tone early with 13 first-quarter points. He ended the day with 25 points, four rebounds, four assists, and a steal. Horford added 12 points, eight rebounds, six assists, a steal, and two blocks. After the Clippers won the third period, 38-24, the Sixers battled back to outscore LA, 34-28, in the fourth quarter, but ultimately fell just short. \u201cOne thing I liked is we kept battling. We held our confidence throughout the game,\u201d Harris said. Tuesday, the team will face the Western Conference-leading Lakers - a challenge, no doubt, but one that the Sixers will look to meet with the same spirit they brought Sunday. \u201cI thought overall, we put ourselves in a position to try to win a game.

The spirit was strong. The ball movementment effective. Shake Milton was playing at another level. Tobias Harris provided a quality scoring punch. Al Horford got into a solid rhythm. The bench stepped up. And the threes, they started to fall. All of those factors - especially the perimeter shooting - were again on display Thursday in Sacramento. This time, they added up to a 125-108 Sixers' win. The victory was the first for the Sixers in four visits to Golden 1 Center, and marked the team's first win outside of South Philadelphia in 10 tries. Harris topped the Sixers with 28 points. He, along with Milton, who dropped 20 points, were critical to a long-range attack that proved critical.  The Sixers shot 45.9% from deep, hitting 17 of 37 attempts. They've now hit at least 16 triples in three consecutive road contests for the first time in team history. Sacramento, meanwhile, managed just 11 threes. Horford made his presence felt all over the place, registering 18 points (7-14 fg) eight rebounds, and six assists. The Sixers outscored the Kings by an astounding 41 points in the 36 minutes the big man played. As for the Sixers' reserve corps, Alec Burks and Raul Neto led the way. Burks notched 17 points, while Neto scored 16, 14 of which came during the final six minutes of Thursday's third period.  Also pivotal to the Sixers' success in Sacramento was offensive rebounding. They outdid the Kings in that category, 14-4, and 13-4 on second-chance points. TURNING POINT The Sixers found themselves ahead by 20 points early in the fourth quarter, but Sacramento kept coming. After the Kings sliced the gap to six, 112-106, the Sixers' vets rose to the occasion. Tobias Harris answered with a jumper, followed by a dunk and two free throws from Al Horford. The sequence triggered a 10-0 spurt that secured the Sixers' win. WORTH NOTING \u2022 The Sixers forced 18 turnovers, and outscored Sacramento, 22-16, in points off turnovers. \u2022 The Sixers led Thursday's game wire-to-wire. \u2022 Mike Scott was the fourth starter to reach double-figures. He finished with 11 points (5-10 fg), seven rebounds, and four assists, and is now shooting 8-for-14 on 3-point attempts during the current road trip. \u2022 De'Aaron Fox paced Sacramento with 23 points. Buddy Hield went for 22. @SIXERS SOCIAL Not to be lost among the many good things from Thursday's dub\u2026 @mikescott @NBCSPhilly+ pic.twitter.com/fOrpbHPHym \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) March 6, 2020 UP NEXT The 76ers will finish their four-game California road trip Saturday at 8:30 PM EST by making their first-ever visit to Chase Center, the new home of the Golden State Warriors (14-48).

And even though the Sixers dropped a 120-107 decision Tuesday to the surging Los Angeles Lakers (47-13), all was not lost. Glenn Robinson III, acquired at this year's trade deadline, provided his strongest showing yet since rejoining the Sixers, tying a career-high of 25 points. The veteran converted 10 of his 15 field goal attempts, including a 3-for-5 effort from 3-point territory. The threes were his first of the season in a Sixers uniform.  Tobias Harris chipped in with 18 points, while Shake Milton and Alec Burks each tallied 12. Forcing a season series split with the Sixers, the Lakers simply got too much from the All-Star duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis. James wielded his way to 14 assists, which paired nicely with 22 points. Davis, however, was the difference-maker. He racked up 37 points behind a sterling 13-for-19 shooting performance, and went 4-for-5 from deep. The Sixers received 55 points from the bench on Tuesday, but were done in by a second quarter that saw them outscored by the Lakers, 37-19. TURNING POINT With the Sixers leading 45-35 midway through the second quarter, Anthony Davis took matters into his own hands. He scored 16 points during a 30-9 blitz that vaulted the Lakers in front, 65-54, at the end of the first half. WORTH NOTING \u2022 Yes, the Sixers might have come up short in both Sunday's loss to the LA Clippers and Tuesday's defeat to the Los Angeles Lakers, but they did shoot the ball at nearly a 45% clip (37-83) from outside the arc.  \u2022 The Lakers' production inside proved pivotal to their efficient offensive attack. They scored 62 points in the paint, and hit 53.5% of their field goals. \u2022 The Sixers scrapped back within single-digits with six minutes to go in regulation. An Anthony Davis three, followed by a LeBron James steal that he took the other way for a right-handed dunk pushed the Lakers' margin to 14, which the Sixers couldn't overcome. @SIXERS SOCIAL A nice nod to the late Laker great.

In the Sixers\u2019 two outings on the road trip thus far, different players have risen to the occasion, putting up admirable fights against some of the league\u2019s best. Sunday against the Clippers, Shake Milton poured in a career-high 39 points. Tuesday against the Lakers, Glen Robinson III tied a career-high 25 points. And while the Sixers took tough losses in both matchups, Brett Brown says there\u2019s been plenty of opportunity to learn and grow while facing adversity. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t roll over,\u201d Brown said after Tuesday\u2019s game. \u201cThey still had fight in them. In general, I see more good than anything.\u201d A notable area of improvement for the squad has come from beyond the arc. Robinson hit the first three 3-pointers of his second tenure as a 76er against the Lakers. Milton added seven threes against the Clippers. The Sixers hit 40.0% of their shots from deep on Tuesday, after converting 48.8% of their threes Sunday. Those marks represent\u00a0 progress, as the Sixers have shot 35.9% from long range this season (and 34.5% on the road). With three of the Sixers\u2019 starters sidelined, Milton and Robinson each rose to the occasion - and their coach appreciated the work. \u201c[Shake] did his G League duties, he comes in and sits on a bench and swings a towel, and now in March, he\u2019s the starting point guard on a pretty good team and just had 39 points on national television,\u201d Brown said of Milton Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s one hell of a story.\u201d And just two days later: \u201cFor Glenn to come in, and shoot that ball with confidence, and play with confidence, I hope, and it should, carry forward,\u201d Brown said. Similar opportunities loom for all the Sixers in Thursday\u2019s matchup. The Sixers took their first meeting with the Kings, 97-91, on Nov. 27. Josh Richardson (concussion), Joel Embiid (left shoulder), and Ben Simmons (back) all remain sidelined. Thursday\u2019s contest tips at 10:00 p.m. ET. Opponent Outlook: The Kings have won six of their seven games since the All-Star break. Point man De\u2019Aaron Fox has scored 20-plus in each of his last six outings, most recently including a 31-point performance against the Wizards on Tuesday. Fox leads his team in scoring and sharing this season, averaging 20.4 points and 6.7 assists per game.

El juego tuvo dos mitades bastantes diferentes, justo antes y justo despu\u00e9s del 52-52 (a falta de 3:27 para el descanso).

Pero el choque cambi\u00f3 radicalmente en la segunda fase del juego. Los Lakers supieron remontar y tras colocar el empate a 52 en el marcador con 3:27 por disputar del segundo cuarto, fueron tomando ventaja y no la cedieron hasta el final del encuentro. Ya al descanso el resultado era favorable a los locales por 65-54, mientras que el tercer periodo se llegaron a obtener ventajas que rozaron la veintena de puntos (93-74 a falta de 2:47 para el final del tercer cuarto). Los Sixers no se dejaron ir se colocaron por debajo de la barrera de los 10 puntos de desventaja, pero al final no sirvi\u00f3 m\u00e1s que para maquillar un poco el resultado final. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, el mejor de los Sixers vino del banquillo. Glen Robinson III se convirti\u00f3 el jugador m\u00e1s destacado de los hombres de Brett Brown, sumando en 31 minutos en pista, 25 puntos gracias a un 10-15 en tiros de campo (3-5 en triples) y sumar adem\u00e1s 4 rebotes. Grandes n\u00fameros para un jugador llegado a la disciplina de los Sixers en fechas recientes, para aportar tiro y anotaci\u00f3n para la segunda unidad de Philadelphia. No fue el \u00fanico jugador de banquillo que sum\u00f3 dobles d\u00edgitos en anotaci\u00f3n, ya que Alec Burks tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 sumar m\u00e1s de diez unidades, al lograr un 2-7 en tiros de campo (1-5 en triples) y un 7-8 en tiros libres (12 puntos en totas), adem\u00e1s de sumar 4 rebotes.

Respecto de los hombres del quinteto titular, mencionar que el mejor fue Tobias Harris que se qued\u00f3 a las puertas de la veintena de puntos.

Shake Milton, que ha revolucionado al equipo en los \u00faltimos juegos, tuvo un promedio de acierto de 4-9 en tiros de campo, sumando 6 rebotes, mientras que Mike Scott tuvo un acierto de 4-8 en tiros de campo (con un 4-7 en triples), adem\u00e1s de sumar 8 rebotes.

Una gran noticia para los fans de los Sixers, que ven como surge un nuevo referente para el equipo, ahora que las lesiones est\u00e1n golpeando al equipo y que la fase m\u00e1s importante de la temporada por fin ha llegado. Shake Milton hizo el partido de su vida con un sensacional registro, que rompi\u00f3 todas sus anteriores marcas. Su mejor juego en la NBA databa de hac\u00eda un mes y medio, 27 puntos, mientras que el duelo ante los Clippers, al descanso llevaba 26 puntos. Todo un s\u00edntoma de lo bien que iba a ser la noche para el jugador de los Sixers. En la segunda mitad sus n\u00fameros no fueron tan impactantes, producto de una m\u00e1s f\u00e9rrea defensa y de un mayor reparto del juego entras sus compa\u00f1eros, pero surgi\u00f3 de nuevo en la recta final del juego para terminar sumando 39 puntos, gracias a un soberbio 14-20 en tiros de campo (7-9 en triples) y 4-5 en tiros libres. Una sensacional estad\u00edstica, que redonde\u00f3 al sumar 3 rebotes y repartir 5 asistencias. El \u00fanico lunar de su actuaci\u00f3n fue que los Sixers no pudieron alzarse con la victoria final en Los Angeles. Y eso que el espect\u00e1culo que se estaba viviendo era impresionante. Con parciales de 34-39 y 36-33, al descanso ambos equipos llegaban al descanso con un gran igualdad y un marcador lleno de puntos, que dejaba ansiosos por ver m\u00e1s baloncesto. Sin embargo, los Clippers supieron pegar un buen esprint en los \u00faltimos seis minutos del tercer periodo, donde cuadraron un parcial de 24-5 que dej\u00f3 tocado al equipo de Brett Brown, que ve\u00eda como se pon\u00eda muy complicada la victoria.

Despite a recent skid since returning from the NBA All-Star Break, the Delaware Blue Coats (19-18) remain in the hunt for the G League playoffs. The 12 upcoming games in March represent the busiest month of the entire season for the squad. Six home games in the final month of the regular season matches the team\u2019s largest monthly total of the current campaign (also played six home games in November).

As the Phoenixville native explains in his piece, rooting for the 76ers is a family affair that spans generations. Previous installments in our Circle of Stars written series have featured contributions from director M. Night Shyamalan, decorated soccer player Carli Lloyd, and Oscar nominated actor Ryan Phillippe. It's probably fitting that part of my origin story as a lifelong sports fan - a lifelong Philadelphia sports fan, that is - can be traced to a YMCA. That's where, in 1969, my dad lived for a couple of years after coming to the United States from India. He had $5 in his pocket, had my uncle as a sponsor, and lived out of a YMCA in Harrisburg before he could get an apartment. A few years later, my mom and older brother came over from India as well. Dad had to establish himself here first, make money, then Mom could get her green card. I was the first kid in my family born in America. Growing up in Phoenixville, sports was my connection - within my family, and to the world outside of it. My dad has always been an avid sports fan. He was raised in Bombay, on cricket. But after coming to America, he quickly immersed himself with Philadelphia's sports teams. He was all in. As it turns out, though, it was mom who had a starring role in my first seminal moment as a Philadelphia sports fan. I mean, how many moms would do this? I was eight years old. It was June 2nd, 1983. If you know your 76ers history even just a little bit, regardless of whether or not you were alive back then, you can probably guess what was happening on that date. The Sixers were about 48 hours removed from sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Finally. The city was ready to party, and I got to be part of it because... My mom pulled me out of school for the parade! I was obsessed with the 1983 team. I remember my parents taking me to a playoff game against the Celtics. I'll never forget being in the Spectrum, in the nosebleeds, and how angry I was walking up the aisle to our seats and seeing a Celtics fan inside our building. I was eight years old, but I remember how mad I was! How was that guy there? That detail aside, it was so amazing that we went to watch a Sixers playoff game as a family. The experience was all part of the build up culminating into the parade happening, and my mom surprising me and my brother that day. I mean, I was going to school, and my mom was like, 'Nope, we're going to the parade.' I was completely stunned. 'We're taking a couple of your friends and a couple of your brother's friends,' she said, and I just remember how cool it was. I was like, 'I got the cool mom who's taking my brother and all of our friends to Philadelphia to go to the parade!' I remember seeing Dr. J on the float on Broad Street. I remember being inside Veterans Stadium, and looking over and there was a guy dressed up as Moses - the actual Moses. He had a broom with him, and he kept on saying, 'Sweeeeeep! 'Sweeeeeep!,' which was obviously a reference to Moses Malone's 'Fo, fo, fo' proclamation.  To me, those are the feelings you never really shake. They always stay with you. And I'm lucky to have had a lifetime full of them, with plenty involving the Sixers. After the '83 championship season, Philly sports was in my DNA. I'm downstairs in my basement playing hoops as a 12, 13-year old kid, and we're the Sixers. We're Dr. J and Moses Malone. As a teenager in the early 1990's, I'm playing basketball in the rain by myself shooting hoops, and I'm Charles Barkley and Hersey Hawkins, matched up with Jordan and Pippin! I'll never forget the playoff series in 1991 against Chicago. I talked to my dad about it, how badly I wanted to go to a playoff game. Lo and behild, another surprise. My dad said he had gotten me and my brother a playoff package! It's 1991, I'm 16, my brother's 23, and my dad was like, 'I got you tickets. You and your brother are going to the whole series!' It was awesome. I was one lucky dude. I remember so much from those playoff games - the sneakers, all the details of who was wearing what, seeing Mike play and seeing him dominante, but also watching Chuck respond. There was nothing better. And this was before Mike won the rings. This was when Mike was known as the scorer and the guy who was going to dunk on everybody. This was when Chuck was the man. He was a freak show every night, and his personality was larger than life! It was great. The vibe at the Spectrum back then was awesome too.  About the Spectrum: I always felt like it was the coolest place in Philadelphia. I'm not exaggerating. There was just a vibe inside that building. Listening to Dave Zinkoff, the PA announcer, with his trademark introductions\u2026 When I went to the Spectrum, I always felt it was going to be a special night. The sights of watching old school players who were legends, who were kind of like superheroes, and this arena was their playground every single night. I still hold onto these things. It feels like back in the day, right? Now, as a 44-year old, I can relate to the guys who, when I was a kid, would tell me stories about watching Wilt Chamberlain and other immortals. For as much as I cherished my memories of the Spectrum, one of my all-time favorite Sixers moments that I actually got to see came at what's now The Center. It was the Crossover game - Allen one-one-one against Michael.\u00a0I was three rows underneath the basket, in the press area, covering the game while I was the student sports director at WRTI, Temple's radio station. I will never forget it. That night was beyond special, because at the time, the Bulls were back at their peak. They won 69 games that season, and they were rock stars everywhere they went. I wasn't born during the Beatles craze, but that season, the Bulls' following felt like it was the sports version of the musical superstars. Everywhere, in every city, everybody knew who they were. They had personalities - Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman - and I was like, 'They can walk into any room and people would recognize them! But March 12, 1997, that night belonged to Allen Iverson (even if the Bulls did win by four). His crossover move on Jordan was A.I.'s introduction to Philadelphia. It was as if he was saying, 'Hey, I'm going to be the star of this league, right?' It was a message to the NBA, 'Don't sleep on me, man.' He scored 37 points that night against one of his idols. In some ways, it was more symbolic than the Stepover against the Lakers in Game 1 of the '01 Finals. The stage was bigger in the FInals, so when you have an iconic moment, you completely go next level. You become a household name, and that's what that was. But for Iverson to do what he did against Jordan - as a rookie! - and you're three rows underneath that basket, I was like, 'Oh my god. This is a new era, and we're going to be relevant again.' We went through a phase after trading Barkley when we were trying to find our identity again, and it was A.I. who made us relevant again. Looking back, it was as if it all started with the Crossover. Another story from the night of the A.I. Crossover. I found myself inside the Bulls' locker room after the game. Pippen had a big night, and he was one of the last ones left before heading to the bus. Then, in walks Dr. J. He was greeted by M.J., and as Dr. J passed on a compliment to Pippen, M.J. sarcastically told Dr. J right in front of Pippen, 'Oh, he has one big night and thinks he's somebody.' Here I was, this college kid watching three all-time greats - my favorite childhood idol Dr. J laughing it up with my teenage idol, Jordan.  The Iverson years, of course, were great. Those were my transition years, when I was on the road, trying to break into TV, living in Missouri and Florida. Then, these last few years, they've been all about sharing new memories with my wife and three kids. It's funny. My two sons, they're now seven and five years old, and they know what I do. They wake up every morning before me, go to their mom, and ask, 'What happened with the Sixers last night?' They'll ask Siri too, and get the score. Then, they wake me up and tell me what happened. Even though I already know what happened, I play along. The next thing you know, they'll be downstairs watching highlights of the Sixers' game on SportsCenter or YouTube. I don't need to tell them to do that. They are so into it. And my daughter, she's three, and even she is so aware. If there's a basketball game on, the first thing she says is, 'Where's Joel Embiid, Daddy?' She knows! She's three and she knows! To be able to explain the game of basketball to my kids, while also experiencing everything that I went through in my childhood, there's nothing better than that. And to do it talking about your favorite team, doing The Process with them, it's been incredible. There's nothing to me that can compare to recreating moments from your childhood with your kids, and your kids actually wanting to do it willingly. Sports have been a family thing for me since I was seven or eight years old, and now, my seven-year old, five-year old, and three-year old are obsessed as well. So what's the meaning behind all these stories and experiences? The big takeaway? For me, when I look back at my life up to this point, some of my fondest memories are connected to sports, whether it's playing outside in my neighborhood, or little league baseball, pop warner football, or YMCA basketball. These memories stick with you. They represent really important building blocks and fundamental life lessons in understanding what teamwork is, and understanding what rooting for something means. They also represent family. They represent my dad, my mom, my brother, my wife, my kids, and my five cousins, who my brother and I text with religiously during games. Despite our family living in different parts of the country - Connecticut, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Washington state - watching the Sixers connects us. It creates a common bond that we will always have, no matter what. Especially with my kids, no matter how old I get, or how uncool I will be in their eyes down the road, we will always come back to a common bond, built by a family's shared love for Philadelphia sports that's now spread over three generations.

Six of these championship bouts have come against the Lakers. That\u2019s a lot of high-stakes action to recount, and we certainly don\u2019t have the time today to go through it all. However, 2020 does mark the 70th and 40th anniversaries of the 1950 and 1980 showdowns with the Lakers, so, with the Sixers visiting the Lakers on Tuesday, let's give those two series a little bit of shine. Sit yourself down and enjoy this look back on the 1980 NBA Finals between the 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers, as well as the 1950 NBA Finals between the Syracuse Nationals and Minneapolis Lakers. EIGHTIES SIXERS The 1979-80 season set a familiar stage for the Sixers of the Eighties: \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nip-and-tuck regular season battle with the Boston Celtics for the Atlantic Division crown.  \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Conference Finals with the Celtics  \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The victor faces the Lakers The only factor missing from the formula was the pesky presence of the Milwaukee Bucks, which would join the Eastern Conference the next season. The eight-man rotation for the 1979-80 Sixers still gives any fan goosebumps: Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Darryl Dawkins, Steve Mix, Caldwell Jones, and Henry Bibby capped off with Lionel Hollins. The southpaw L-Train was acquired midseason to replace the injured Doug Collins.  The club finished with 59 wins\u2014the most since 1968\u2014but still finished two games behind Boston for the Atlantic crown. No matter. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics were dusted off in five games as the Sixers made the Finals for the first time since 1977. Although the 1980 Finals is now best remembered for rookie Magic Johnson\u2019s superlative Game 6 performance, the real trouble man for the Sixers was regular season MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Tipping off Game 1 in the Great Western Forum, Kareem led the Lakers with 33 points, 14 rebounds, six blocks, and five assists. A 31-17 Laker scoring edge in the 3rd quarter gave L.A. a relatively comfortable 109-102 win. For Game 2, Kareem was again a menace (38 points, 14 boards, and five swats), but the Sixers hit back with a trio of 20-point scorers. Chocolate Thunder rumbled to 25 points and four blocks; Maurice Cheeks had 23 of his own points to go with 10 assists and six steals; and Dr. J had a dazzling 23 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, and five blocks. The Lakers mounted a dangerous fourth quarter comeback bid that nearly erased an 18-point gap, but the Sixers held on for a 107-104 win. With the series tied 1-1, the scene changed to the Spectrum and the two teams again made a split. Game 3 saw Abdul-Jabbar continue his rampage (33 points, 14 rebounds, and four blocks), as Los Angeles made off with an easy 111-101 win. Finally, in Game 4, the skyhook machine was slowed down to just 23 points on 11-for-27 shooting. But the rookie Magic Johnson swerved in for 28 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists to keep the contest tight all the way through. The Doctor had another grand performance including his iconic swooping behind-the-backboard lay-up. And to seal the deal, defensive mastermind Bobby Jones stole the Lakers\u2019 inbound pass with six seconds left to stop any surprise conclusion. The game ended 105-102, in favor of the Sixers. For Game 5, the series moved back to Southern California. Erving and Abdul-Jabbar engaged in one of the greatest duels in Finals history. The Doctor flew across the court for a stat-stuffing 36 points, nine rebounds, six assists, four steals, and two blocks. Meanwhile, Kareem suffered a severely sprained ankle during the game, but played through the pain to the tune of 40 points and 15 boards. The Lakers wrung out a 108-103 win to take a 3-2 series lead. However, with the adrenaline worn off, Kareem was a no-go for Game 6 back in Philadelphia. And this is when Magic Johnson went off for his 42-point, 15-rebound performance. The Sixers\u2019 starters did a typically fine job and Steve Mix had his best game of the series off the bench with 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting. So, what led to the Sixers' 123-107 loss? Rebounds, particularly on the Lakers\u2019 offensive glass. Even without their goggled captain, the Lakers outrebounded the Sixers overall 52-36, with a 17-7 edge on offensive boards. Jamaal Wilkes, often forgotten in the Game 6 outcome, posting 37 points and 10 rebounds, six of them offensive. Erving finished with 27 points, but his NBA title would have to wait. FIRST DANCE  30 years earlier, the inaugural title showdown between the Sixers and Lakers franchises occurred when the Syracuse Nationals squared off against the Minneapolis Lakers. The 1949-50 season was the first of a consolidated NBA that incorporated teams from Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball League (NBL). The Nationals hailed from the NBL. In this first NBA season, they shocked the league with a 51-13 overall record, highlighted by a scintillating 16-1 start. Little in Syracuse's first three seasons\u2014all in the NBL\u2014pointed to a breakout year. In 1947, the team had a 21-23 record. In 1948, a 24-36 record. 1949 did give an inkling to the impending powerhouse when the Nats went 40-23. But 1950 saw the maturation of second-year players Dolph Schayes and Billy Gabor along with player-coach Al Cervi\u2019s final star-level campaign. All this gave Syracuse the unexpected nudge into a juggernaut. Still, the playoffs were the proving ground, and Minneapolis had been battle-tested behind its awesome duo of George Mikan and Jim Pollard. In 1948, they won the NBL title. In 1949, they won the BAA title. Now, in 1950, they looked to win the NBA title after finishing the regular season with a 51-17 record. (Yes, the Lakers played 68 games while the Nats played 64 games. Don\u2019t ask me why, I wasn\u2019t the schedule maker.) Given their better win percentage, Syracuse held homecourt advantage over the Lakers and that was a basketball blessing. The Lakers had gone a ridiculous 33-1 in Minnesota during the regular season. Meanwhile, Syracuse had also gone 33-1 at home during the season. The Lakers\u2019 championship experience proved the razor-thin difference in the series. Despite being on the road, the Lakers stole Game 1 in Syracuse by a final score of 68-66. Mikan pummeled the Nats for 37 points while his partner in crime Pollard chipped in 14 points. Schayes led the way with 19 points for Syracuse. But the decisive figure was Bob Harrison. The guard unfurled a 40-foot shot with three seconds left that swished through the net breaking the 66-66 tie and giving Minneapolis the win. Although nothing is ever certain, it sure seems that if Harrison had missed that shot, the Nationals would have won the title. For the rest of the series, the two teams easily defended their homecourt. \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game 2\u2014MPLS 85 @ SYR 91 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game 3\u2014SYR 77 @ MPLS 91 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game 4\u2014SYR 69 @ MPLS 77 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game 5\u2014MPLS 76 @ SYR 83 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game 6\u2014SYR 95 @ MPLS 110 But that\u2019s part of the growing pains for a young team like those Nats. Schayes and his mates would make it back to the Finals in 1954. and win it all in 1955. Same goes for the 80s Sixers. Erving and his band were back in the Finals in 1982 and finally won the title in 1983. All's well that ends well. And now, in the 21st century, here are the Sixers and Lakers, once again jockeying for positioning to come out of their respective conferences. Follow @SixersHistory on Twitter or Instagram. "}
{"team": "sixers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/milton-has-historic-performance-against-clippers", "date": "2020-03-01 00:00:00", "tags": ["Burks, Alec", "Harris, Tobias", "Milton, Shake", "Richardson, Josh", "Scott, Mike"], "article": " SNAPSHOT When the 76ers (37-24) returned from the All-Star Game break, Brett Brown met individually with each player on the roster. His sitdown with Shake Milton was pretty transparent. \"You're not [going] to play, you're not in the rotation\" is what Brown remembers telling the second-year guard. He explained to Milton that for the home stretch, the Sixers were planning to turn ball-handling duties over to a combination Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, and the recently acquired Alec Burks, who was picked up at the trade deadline. But in the same breath, Brown also told Milton this: \"You have to stay ready.\" A few days later, the Sixers lost Simmons for an indefinite period of time due to a back injury. All of a sudden, there was a need. All of a sudden, Milton's world changed. With the Sixers shorthanded, Milton, as it turned out, would in fact be playing. And based on what he's done with this newfound opportunity, he probably won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Sunday's performance was simply the latest, emphatic example, one that was broadcast to dozens of millions of NBA fans on national television and social media.  Under the bright lights of a matinee match-up at STAPLES Center against the LA Clippers (41-19), the 23-year old Milton erupted for 39 points, a new career-high, and the second-highest scoring total for a second-year Sixer in the last two decades. Along the way, Milton tied an all-time NBA record by making 13 consecutive 3-pointers. The streak began three games ago against the Cleveland Cavaliers, when Milton finished the evening 3-for-3 from deep. He then went a perfect 5-for-5 in Thursday's victory over the New York Knicks, and started Sunday's competitive battle, a 136-130 loss, 5-for-5. Outside observers may have been surprised by Milton. He, on the other hand, downplayed the outing a bit, reflecting on his success in matter-of-fact terms. \"I'm just going out there and hooping. I'm confident, and getting more and more confident as the games.\" More on Milton's mind was the outcome of Sunday's contest. The Sixers came close, but couldn't bounce back from a 28-9 Clipper run that ended the third quarter. \"It was a great team effort,\" he said. \"Everybody else just tried to rally. It was a great effort. It just wasn't enough.\" Tobias Harris posted 25 points (11-21 fg / 3-7 3fg), while Alec Burks added 15 points (5-13 fg / 3-7 3fg) off the bench. Richardson got off to a strong start in Sunday's game, connecting on his first four shots before being forced to exit in the second quarter due to a concussion.  The Sixers built up a 25-11 edge midway through the first period. They trailed by two at the break, then went ahead by seven in the middle of the third. Milton hit his sixth and seventh threes in the final three minutes of regulation, but the Clippers secured their fourth win in a row at the free throw line. \"His effort was amazing out there,\" Harris said of Milton. \"We all know he can play. I think now with the opportunities, he's getting the right shots to go out there and do his thing and get good looks and score.\" Starting in place of Simmons the past four games, Milton has averaged 21.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 4.8 assists, while hitting nearly 74% of his 3-point tries (17-23). \"Life changes, things happen,\" said Brown. \"Now in March, he's the starting point guard on a pretty good team, and just had 39 points on national TV against a candidate to win an NBA championship. It's a hell of a story.\" People might not have been paying attention before. They certainly will be now. TURNING POINT \u2022 About five minutes into Sunday's third quarter, Al Horford was involved in a key sequence, first hitting a three, then throwing down a dunk after Mike Scott came up with a steal back the other way. The five-point swing gave the Sixers an 87-80 lead, and prompted an LA timeout. In what should have been to the surprise no one, Kawhi Leonard came back with a vengeance. He proceeded to score seven points during a 9-0 spurt that vaulted the Clippers back in front, and laid the foundation for their big game-changing run.. WORTH NOTING \u2022 The Sixers cranked out 39 points in Sunday's first quarter, their highest point total in any quarter of any road game this season. \u2022 The Sixers' 21 3-pointers not only matched a season-high (12.25.19 vs. MIL) and set a season-high for a road game, it equaled a franchise record, too. \u2022 Tobias Harris and Mike Scott, whom the Sixers landed in a trade last February, received tribute videos from the Clippers during Sunday's first half. It was the duo's first game back at STAPLES Center since the deal.  \u2022 Scott had a quality showing off the bench. He went 3-for-4 from beyond the arc, and notched 11 points. \u2022 Kawhi Leonard topped the Clippers with 30 points. Paul George, Lou Williams, and Montrezl Harrell each had 24 points. @SIXERS SOCIAL Yes, Shake made some history Sunday with his outside shooting, but this two-way play was arguably his top highlight of the day. OH SHAKE.#PhilaUnite |  @ABCNetwork pic.twitter.com/geSDpV6H80 \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) March 1, 2020 UP NEXT The Sixers' two-game stop in Los Angeles wraps up Tuesday with the club's second and final meeting of the regular season with the Western Conference-leading Lakers (45-13).

Tobias Harris took over the game early, scoring 14 first-quarter points and finishing with 34 points total. The team also saw key contributions from Al Horford (15 pts, 7 reb, 9 ast) and Shake Milton (19 pts, 3 reb, 4 ast, 2 blk). Here\u2019s some of what was said postgame\u2026 After a loss Wednesday in Cleveland that began the Sixers' back-to-back, Brett Brown applauded Harris and Horford postgame for bouncing back in Thursday\u2019s outing. \u201cThose two were excellent tonight and we needed it all. After a disappointing team performance [at Cleveland], that they would wish they could have back, for them and us to come out the way that those two did was a great sign and it doesn\u2019t surprise me. They are good people and they work hard, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d Horford echoed Brown\u2019s thoughts, and applauded Harris for his commitment to dominate early and often. \u201cIt was very important. It doesn\u2019t matter what [the Knicks'] record is, we have to come out and set the tone and I think Tobias, from the beginning, did that and took off from there.\u201d New York\u2019s Maurice Harkless also gave Harris props: \u201cTobias can always score the ball and tonight he was great. He was great all game. He started off the game really well for them and then he just kept it going throughout the game\u2026we\u2019ve got to find a way to stop guys like that.\u201d For the second time in as many days, Shake Milton rose to the occasion starting in place of Ben Simmons. Milton shot 5-for-5 from 3-point range Thursday alone, and totaled 39 points in the team\u2019s back-to-back. Brown was proud of the second-year guard\u2019s performance: \u201cWhat a fantastic story of late. It\u2019s getting to the stage where the unique performances, performances that catch your eye have become more and more frequent. To knock out a back-to-back is even more impressive. He\u2019s just becoming consistently reliable on a bunch of things.\u201d Harris also credited Milton, not only for his ability to step in and run the offense, but for his off-court preparation and work ethic as well: \u201cJust his fearlessness on the floor. Shake is a really good player, but he has the confidence in himself and in his game to go out night after night and play. He goes out there, he plays, he makes shots. He\u2019s improved his three-point shot, so anytime that we see him open we try to give him the ball. He\u2019s been shooting it really well. He puts in a lot of work and he works really hard. I\u2019m happy for him and every time he gets an opportunity, he takes advantage of it. Tonight, he was huge for us.\u201d Another player leaving his mark on the win was Kyle O\u2019Quinn, who grabbed 10 rebounds in 14 minutes of play. In Joel Embiid\u2019s absence, O\u2019Quinn also recorded six points and four blocks in 12 minutes against Cleveland. On both nights of the back-to-back, Brown praised O\u2019Quinn for staying ready and determined to capitalize on such opportunities: \u201cWe had a day off on Sunday, and I was in the gym with my son and I come and he\u2019s doing 17s. It\u2019s side-to-side sprints to see if you can get 17 touches in a minute. That\u2019s a common basketball conditioning drill. I just come in the gym and there he is, doing his 17\u2019s, sweating and getting his shots. He\u2019s good people, he\u2019s a locker room favorite, he\u2019s funny and he\u2019s a good man. He actually has a great sense of humor. To see him come in and provide that physical punch after the work that he has put in, I respect him and I appreciate him as a team member on this team.\u201d Next up for the 76ers is the team\u2019s final four-game road trip of the season, traveling to the West Coast to visit the Clippers, Lakers, Kings, and Warriors.

Una victoria sin Ben Simmons y tampoco Joel Embiid, ambos aquejados de lesiones y que han dejado paso a Shake Milton y Tobias Harris como grandes protagonistas de los \u00faltimos juegos de los Sixers. La victoria parec\u00eda que se producir\u00eda de un modo m\u00e1s sencillo del que al final fue, a tenor de lo vivido en los primeros minutos de juego. Si bien los Sixers lograron marcharse del primer cuarto con tan solo cinco puntos de ventaja y con las espadas por todo lo alto, al t\u00e9rmino del segundo parcial, el resultado ya reflejaba una m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda ventaja para el equipo de Brett Brown, que se marchaba a vestuarios con un 61-46 a su favor. Un resultado que invitaba a pensar que la segunda mitad ser\u00eda un puro tr\u00e1mite, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que los Knicks tienen uno de los peores registros de la NBA, en estos momentos. Pero los Knicks se motivan cuando juegan frente a Philadelphia y como era obvio no iban a regalar la victoria. Los visitantes se repusieron en el tercer periodo y llegaron a estrechar el marcador con tan cinco minutos por disputar del tercer periodo (76-72), distancia que se ampliar\u00eda poco a poco por parte de los locales (105-89 con casi siete minutos para el final del juego), pero viviendo un final un poco emocionante, al lograr los de la Gran Manzana volver a tener una desventaja de tan solo cinco puntos (107-102) con dos minutos todav\u00eda por disputar. Sin embargo, los Sixers manejaron bien los instantes finales del partido y en realidad no vieron seriamente comprometida la victoria en los minutos finales. Y un nuevo triunfo lleg\u00f3 para los Sixers en su templo del Sur de Philadelphia, consolidando su poder\u00edo en casa y de paso, terminando el mes de febrero con muy buen sabor de boca. Como he mencionado antes, con la ausencia de Simmons y de Embiid en la pista, Tobias Harris y Shake Milton se han convertido en los m\u00e1ximos exponentes de la ofensiva de los Sixers, en los \u00faltimos juegos. En Cleveland el m\u00e1ximo exponente de los Sixers fue Milton, bien secundado por Harris. En esta ocasi\u00f3n ha sido al contrario, destacando profundamente en ataque Tobias Harris y siendo muy escoltado por Milton y tambi\u00e9n por Al Horford. Harris termin\u00f3 el encuentro con 34 puntos anotados, gracias a un 14-21 en tiros de campo (3-6 en triples), adem\u00e1s de lograr un 3-3 en tiros libres. Grandes n\u00fameros a los que a\u00f1adir 7 rebotes y 7 asistencias, que le dejaron incluso cerca del triple-doble. Por su parte, Milton estuvo muy cerca de volver a estar en la veintena de puntos anotados. Se qued\u00f3 en 19 puntos para su cuenta particular, gracias a un 6-7 en tiros de campo (con un 5-5 en triples), adem\u00e1s de un 2-2 en tiros libres y a\u00f1adir 3 rebotes y 4 asistencias a su estad\u00edstica, en los 32 minutos que estuvo en pista. El dominicano Al Horford tambi\u00e9n estuvo cerca del triple-doble, al igual que Harris. El poderoso jugador interior de los Sixers, acab\u00f3 el enfrentamiento ante los Knicks con 15 puntos anotados, gracias a un 5-10 en tiros de campo (con un 4-4 en triples) y sumando 7 rebotes y 9 asistencias. Otros dos jugadores que superaron la barrera de la decena de puntos, fueron Josh Richardson (11 puntos con un 5-13 en tiros de campo, adem\u00e1s de sumar 7 rebotes y 3 asistencias) y Furkan Kormaz (que fue el mejor de la banca de Philadelphia con 11 puntos y un 5-9 en tiros de campo). Ahora los Sixers despiden el mes de febrero y se adentran en el pen\u00faltimo mes de competici\u00f3n, de la temporada regular. Y la primera piedra de toque va a ser muy dura, ya que los Clippers esperan en el Staples Center a unos Sixers mermados por las lesiones, pero con mucha necesidad de poder obtener buenos resultados y recuperar las buenas sensaciones, de cara a los playoffs, que cada vez est\u00e1n m\u00e1s cerca.

Un esguince en el hombro izquierdo de Joel Embiid, le impidi\u00f3 estar en el juego desde el primer periodo y con ello se esfumaron las opciones de Philadelphia de vencer en Cleveland a los Cavs. Embiid ven\u00eda de hacer un incre\u00edble juego ante los Hawks de Atlanta en casa, despertando la ilusi\u00f3n en la fanaticada de Philly, pero este rev\u00e9s hace que de nuevo se instale la incertidumbre acerca del equipo, que ya ha sufrido la lesi\u00f3n de Ben Simmons, que no ha tomando parte en los \u00faltimos juegos de los Sixers. Embiid no pudo estar en el partido m\u00e1s de ocho minutos, lo que aprovecharon los locales para ir alej\u00e1ndose de Philadelphia poco a poco, con ventajas que se mov\u00edan en torno a la decena de puntos, hasta llegar al descanso (44-55 favorable a los Cavs). Ya en el tercer periodo, Cleveland asest\u00f3 un duro golpe a las ilusiones de los Sixers, con un inicio demoledor de la segunda mitad, llegando a obtener una veintena de puntos de ventaja (50-70 con 6:29 para el final del tercer periodo), ventaja que fue administrando poco a poco, desde ese momento, hasta el final del juego, con un \u00fanico momento de incertidumbre para los locales. Fue ya en el \u00faltimo periodo, donde un intento de remontada, llev\u00f3 a los Sixers a estar a tan solo cinco punto de los Cavaliers (80-85 con 9:13 por disputar antes del final del partido), pero el intento de reacci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 en solo un intento y al final todo se diluy\u00f3, dando un nuevo triunfo a los Cavs en su feudo. Con Embiid lesionado y contando con tan solo ocho minutos en pista (anotando tan solo 3 puntos), el testigo de ser el mejor de los Sixers en el juego lo recogi\u00f3 Shake Milton. N sus 37 minutos en pista logr\u00f3 un meritorio 8-14 en tiros de campo y 4-6 en triples, lo que le vali\u00f3 para alcanzar la veintena de puntos anotados, a los que a\u00f1adi\u00f3 4 rebotes (todos en defensa) y 4 asistencias. No fue el \u00fanico jugador de los Sixers que logr\u00f3 dobles d\u00edgitos en anotaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n lo logr\u00f3 Tobias Harris, que no estuvo tan inspirado como en otras ocasiones y con un 4-13 en tiros de campo, tan solo pudo aportar al equipo 11 puntos, 4 rebotes, 3 asistencias y 3 robos de bal\u00f3n. Al Horford, que regresaba al quinteto titular de los Sixers, tambi\u00e9n se uni\u00f3 al grupo de jugadores que alcanzaban dobles d\u00edgitos en anotaci\u00f3n, acabando el juego con un 4-10 en tiros de campo, 2-5 en triples, y sumando 10 puntos, adem\u00e1s de 5 rebotes, 5 asistencias y 3 robos de bal\u00f3n. Por su parte, Josh Richardson estuvo a puntos de alcanzar la decena de puntos anotados, pero que qued\u00f3 en 9 puntos, tras un 4-12 en tiros de campo (1-5 en triples), sumando adem\u00e1s 8 rebotes, 4 asistencias y 2 robos de bal\u00f3n, sin contar 2 tapones que a\u00f1adi\u00f3 a su estad\u00edstica. Los mejores de la banca de Philadelphia fue una vez m\u00e1s Furkan Korkmaz, que en 25 minutos en pista, alcanz\u00f3 14 puntos y un 4-12 en tiros de campo. Casi todo lo lanz\u00f3 desde m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la l\u00ednea de tres puntos (4-11), pero no pudo estar tan sumamente acertado como en otras ocasiones. Tambi\u00e9n ray\u00f3 a un buen nivel Alec Burks, que sum\u00f3 13 puntos en 17 minutos en pista, logrando un 6-12 en tiros de campo (1-4 en triples), adem\u00e1s de sumar 2 rebotes 2 asistencias y 2 robos de bal\u00f3n. Ahora toca pasar p\u00e1gina, recuperar a los jugadores lesionados y pensar en vencer a los Knicks en el pr\u00f3ximo juego, que se disputar\u00e1 en el Sur de Philadelphia.

Joel Embiid was forced to leave the contest in the final seconds of the first quarter due to a left shoulder sprain. He didn't return, finishing with three points in seven minutes. Going into the evening, the Sixers were already down one All-Star in Ben Simmons (back). The loss of a second proved to be too much. Cleveland led wire-to-wire, and went up by as many as 20 points midway through the third period. Behind a spirited second-half performance from Shake Milton, the Sixers fought back, closing within five points early in the fourth.  They were still within single-digits with three minutes to go, but back-to-back threes from the Cavaliers put the tilt out of reach. TURNING POINT The Cavaliers set the tone from the jump. They won Wednesday's first quarter, 28-17, which forced the Sixers to play catch-up the rest of the game.

While the Sixers were facing the Atlanta Hawks, the 76ers and Harris Family Charitable Foundation celebrated their ongoing relationship with Philadelphia's Police Athletic League (PAL) by hosting the organization\u2019s 34th annual PAL night. More than 80 PAL youth were invited to Monday\u2019s game, as were leaders of the program.  Through PAL, police officers across the Philadelphia community participate in athletic and educational programs alongside the city\u2019s youth. \u201cPAL is really unique in Philly - it helps about 10,000 kids,\" said 76ers Managing Partner Josh Harris. \"The police are in the communities, doing something great - working with kids directly to make their lives better, to teach them sports, to work with them on homework.\" For Harris' wife, Marjorie, partnering with PAL represents a fulfilling opportunity. \u201cIt is the best part of being involved in this organization,\u201d Marjorie Harris said. \u201cAt the end of the day, what we\u2019re doing is trying to help enrich these kids' lives, give them something to work towards, and see that there\u2019s a world of people out there who care about them.\u201d The Harrises hoped for a night full of fun for the PAL kids in attendance, allowing them to be inspired to keep chasing success. \u201c[If we can help] allow them to dream, and feel that their dreams are achievable, for me, as the mother of five children, I think that I\u2019ve done my job for my own kids, and for other kids,\u201d said Marjorie Harris.  Prior to tipoff, Tobias Harris was presented with the PAL Community Service Award, which honored the Sixer forward for his steadfast and sincere commitment to bettering the Philadelphia community. At halftime, members of the PAL program took part in an exhibition basketball game against Philadelphia media personalities. \u201cTheir job is to have fun,\" Josh Harris said about the PAL youth. \"They\u2019re here because they\u2019ve done a great job at PAL, and we want to reward them, and get them more motivated to do an even better job so they can come back to The Center.\" As far as motivation to return goes, there was no shortage of entertainment and excitement throughout the evening.

And in doing so, the Sixers also received quality contributions from a handful of key players whom the team will be counting on for however long Ben Simmons (back) and Joel Embiid (left shoulder) are out. From the jump, Tobias Harris attacked with purpose. He scored the Sixers' first seven points, and added seven more before the opening period was through. His 23 first-half points marked the second-highest total of his career. The veteran finished the evening with 34 overall, one shy of his season-high.  Al Horford turned in a solid showing as well, flirting with what would have been the third triple-double of his career. Providing a couple of clutch baskets in the fourth quarter, he posted 15 points, seven boards, and a season-best nine assists. Listen to a recap of the game on the 76ers Podcast Network Josh Richardson also stepped up in the second half, during which he notched all 11 of his points. Shake Milton, making his second straight start, went for 19.  On a night New York never really went away, it was Harris who helped secure the victory.\u00a0 The Knicks had trimmed a once-20 point deficit to five, 107-102, with two minutes to go. Harris then proceeded to nail a 3-pointer, and following a Sixers' stop at the other end, he set up a corner triple for Milton that widened the gap to 113-102 with 74 seconds left. At that point, the Sixers' sixth win in their last eight games was all but assured. TURNING POINT With Harris leading the charge, the Sixers strung together a decisive 8-2 mini-run in the final two minutes to finally put away their long-time Atlantic Division rival. WORTH NOTING \u2022 Starting in place of Ben Simmons the past two games (Cleveland, New York), Shake Milton has combined to score 39 points. He converted 6 of his 7 shots against the Knicks, while going 5-for-5 from deep.  \u2022 The Sixers finished 15-for-31 (48.4%) from beyond the arc. It was the Sixers' most efficient 3-point shooting performance in a game this season in which they hit 15+ threes. \u2022 Kyle O'Quinn made the most of his 14 minutes off the bench.

Amar\u2019e Stoudemire truly put the \u2018power\u2019 in power forward, as he was nearly unstoppable in the paint across an entire decade. But how did the generational talent fall all the way to pick nine in the 2002 NBA Draft? Well, fortunately for the Suns, they were one of his first workouts. In a time where players were able to enter the draft directly from high school, Stoudemire was just a teenager looking to live out his dream. Scout.com listed the Florida native as not only a five star recruit, but the number one high school player in the nation. Stoudemire had originally committed to play college hoops at the University of Memphis, the 19-year-old already had the frame and skills to play against the best in the world and decided to make his dream a reality by declaring for the NBA Draft.  While an upstart Suns team featuring a young Joe Johnson, Shawn Marion and Stephon Marbury seemed like the perfect fit for the dynamic big man, then-owner Jerry Colangelo was not the type to draft prospects straight out of high school. However, Stoudemire\u2019s performance at the 2002 McDonald\u2019s All-American Game had Colangelo thinking about making an exception. \u201cI was not a proponent of drafting high school kids,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cThen I saw him perform in the McDonald\u2019s open and he was like a man among boys. I said to Bryan [Colangelo] to Mark West to our staff, \u2018Bring him in. I want to see this guy.\u201d  The Suns interest in Amar\u2019e was apparent and it didn\u2019t take long for that feeling to become mutual. \u201cI fell in love with the city of Phoenix from the moment I touched down,\u201d Stoudemire said. \u201cThere was a certain energy of the city once I landed. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I didn\u2019t know how the workout was going to go, but I was motivated and focused.\u201d Once the workout started, jaws began to drop. \u201cHe clearly stood out in the gym as one of the most fierce competitors and athletic young men then I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said former Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo. \u201cThere was something that just stood out about him, even personality wise. He had a star appeal to him that made you feel very comfortable that you had something special.\u201d \u201cHe impressed the heck out of me,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cThe mere fact that he had the background that he did. That he was just standing there. He was a physical specimen, for sure. Couldn\u2019t shoot the ball, but he had everything else.\u201d Between his athleticism, finesse and relentless motor, the 19-year-old was putting on a show in Phoenix. \u201cWe had the test to check their vertical,\u201d said Frank Johnson, the team\u2019s head coach at the time. \u201cWhen he jumped straight up in the air and touched the numbers everyone\u2019s mouth [dropped]. Literally just went, \u2018Wow. Should we stop this workout now?\u2019 It was just an amazing workout because he wanted more. He wanted to show you more.\u201d Following just the first day of the workout, Jerry\u2019s mind was already made up. \u201cI think he did something when we were talking and Jerry just said, \u2018This is the guy we are taking,\u201d Bryan said. The Suns identified the perfect fit to complement their budding core, but now it was just a matter of Stoudemire dropping all the way down to the ninth pick in the draft. \u201cI would only tell you that there were a lot people who evaluated Amar\u2019e and maybe not everyone evaluated him the way that we did,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cWe made a decision that he was who we wanted at nine if he was on the board. So, we did everything we could, within the rules, to make sure that he was the guy available at number nine when it rolled around.\u201d Jerry kept Stoudemire in Phoenix overnight and took him out to an Arizona Diamondbacks game before putting him right back in the gym the next morning. \u201cOnce I got to travel around and see the city a little more, going to the Diamondbacks game during that time, I felt like I was already drafted,\u201d Stoudemire said. \u201cBefore the draft, I felt like I was home.\u201d The Suns wanted Stoudemire and Stoudemire wanted the Suns. As one of the first teams to witness the generational talent in an NBA workout setting, Jerry wanted to do his best to keep it that way. \u201cI called his agent and said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know where he goes in the draft. We\u2019re drafting number nine, but we want him and he wants us. So, I\u2019ll put the ball in your court. I don\u2019t want him going to any other workouts, but that\u2019s your call,\u201d Jerry said. Stoudemire didn\u2019t work out for any of the eight teams above them as the Suns looked poised to land the themselves a player they felt could dominate in Phoenix. \u201cWe were very fortunate that he did not work out for teams that were above us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but he didn\u2019t. Of course, at that time, not many teams would draft you if you didn\u2019t work out. We got very lucky there.\u201d However, on the eve of the 2002 NBA Draft, the Los Angeles Clippers called the Suns out on their gamesmanship and attempted to call their bluff. \u201cThe Clippers called Bryan and said, \u2018You guys are hiding out Amar\u2019e Stoudemire. We\u2019re drafting eighth. You\u2019re ninth. We\u2019re going to take him,\u201d Jerry said. His response: \u201cTake him. You\u2019re ahead of us. You\u2019re entitled to take whoever you wish.\u201d The next day, the draft began to unfold with the Suns uncertain if Stoudemire would fall past the the Clippers. First pick \u2013 Houston Rockerts - Yao Ming Second pick \u2013 Chicago Bulls \u2013 Jay Williams Third pick \u2013 Golden State Warriors \u2013 Mike Dunleavy Jr. Fourth pick \u2013 Memphis Grizzlies \u2013 Drew Gooden Fifth pick \u2013 Denver Nuggets \u2013 Nikoloz Tskitishvili Sixth Pick \u2013 Cleveland Cavaliers \u2013 Dajuan Wagner Seventh Pick \u2013 New York Knicks \u2013 Nen\u00ea Eighth Pick \u2013 Los Angeles Clippers \u2013 Chris Wilcox \u201cWith the ninth pick in the 2002 NBA Draft, the Phoenix Suns select Amar\u2019e Stoudmire from Cypress Creek High School in Orlando, Florida.\u201d \u201cThey took Wilcox, a forward from Maryland,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cWe get Amar\u2019e at number nine.\u201d  \u201cI guess you could say he fell to number nine,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHow amazing is that?\u201d The answer: just as amazing as his production during his rookie season. Stoudemire played all 82 games for the Suns, averaging 13.5 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.1 blocks that year. Despite being the only high schooler in the draft and falling all the way to pick nine, Stoudemire was named Rookie of the Year and he immediately became a force to be reckoned with throughout the league.  \u201cA year later, I remember walking out of Staples Center with Coach (Alvin) Gentry. He was coaching the Clippers at the time. He said, \u2018You got our guy.\u2019 I said, \u2018How did we get your guy when you picked before us?,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cHe laughed and said, \u2018Come on Bryan. You know that was our guy.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, you should have taken him if that was your guy.\u201d Rookie of the Year honors was just the beginning for Stoudemire as he continued on to become one of the greatest players to ever wear a Phoenix Suns uniform. In his eight years with the Suns, he earned himself five NBA All-Star selections (third most in Suns history) and was named to the All-NBA team four times (tied for the third most in Suns history). \u201cIt turned out to be such a wonderful pick for the organization,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cIt turned out great. Sometimes you\u2019re right. Sometimes you\u2019re wrong. That one we went into with a certain degree of confidence that we had the right player picked.\u201d Over his eight seasons in Phoenix from 2002-2010, the man known as STAT, short for \u201cStanding Tall and Talented\u201d, averaged 21.4 points on 54.4% shooting. Among players to shoot at least 50% from the field over this timespan, he ranked 1st in the NBA with his 21.4 points per game. A strong free throw shooter who got to the line often in addition to his efficiency from the field, he posted a True Shooting Percentage of 60.6% with the Suns, the 2nd-best mark of any NBA player over this time frame (min. 1,500 made field goals) behind only his teammate for much of this time, Hall of Famer Steve Nash. What started as an unlikely chance for the Suns to land the star talent, turned into one of the greatest draft picks in franchise history.  On the Suns\u2019 career regular-season leaderboard: Ranks 5th in double-doubles (200) Ranks 6th in points (11,035) Ranks 3rd in rebounds (4,613) Ranks 5th in blocks (722) Ranks 3rd in free throws made and attempted (3,044, 4,018) Ranks 11th in games (516) In career per-game averages among Suns players (min. 100 regular season games): Ranks 4th in points per game (21.4) Ranks 7th in blocks per game (1.40) Ranks 11th in field goal percentage (.544) Ranks 13th in rebounds per game (8.9) On the Suns\u2019 all-time playoff leaderboard: Ranks 2nd in points per game (24.2) Ranks 5th in points (1,258) Ranks 5th in rebounds per game (9.2) Ranks 4th in rebounds (479) Ranks 3rd in blocks (94) Ranks 2nd in free throws made and attempted (355, 474) Ranks 5th in field goals made (450) Ranks 8th in field goals attempted (861) Next stop, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame?

Brett Brown's club will be looking to quickly move past Wednesday's loss in Cleveland. \u201cIt\u2019s the good thing with the NBA - in 24 hours, you\u2019ve got a chance to move this aside and go try to find a win,\u201d he said. In the absence of Ben Simmons (back) and Joel Embiid (who left the game in first quarter with a left shoulder sprain), Shake Milton was a bright spot for the Sixers. Getting the starting nod, Milton finished with a team-high 20 points, along with four rebounds, four assists, and a block. Milton shot 4-for-6 from long range, and 8-for-14 from the field. Brown, however, was most impressed by Milton\u2019s defensive improvement. \u201cHe\u2019s always had that poise. From an intellectual standpoint, he\u2019s grown on how to manage a game, incrementally, in significant ways,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd I think his defense has stood out maybe more than all of that.\u201d In his 26 appearances this season, Milton is averaging 7.2 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.8 assists in 16.5 minutes per game. Of those 26 outings, Milton has started on 10 occasions in either guard spot, filling in for both Josh Richardson and now Simmons. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to stay ready,\u201d Milton said. \u201c[I\u2019m] doing whatever I can to be ready for whatever comes my way.\u201d Al Horford was also pleased by the second-year Milton\u2019s performance. \u201cI was very happy to see him being able to come out and play aggressive in that way. He\u2019s a guy that can really shoot the ball well,\u201d Horford said. The Sixers have won all three of their matchups with the Knicks (who are also facing the second night of a back-to-back) this season. Most recently, the Sixers topped New York, 90-87, at Madison Square Garden on Jan 18. Thursday\u2019s contest tips at 7:00 p.m. ET. Opponent Outlook: The Knicks have dropped five straight heading into their meeting with the Sixers, including their first two stops on their current road trip in Houston and Charlotte. After dealing Marcus Morris Sr. to the Clippers, Julius Randle now leads New York in scoring and rebounding, averaging 19.0 points and 9.6 boards per game. Randle notched a 17-point, 12-rebound double-double in Houston on Monday, and scored a team-high 18 points in Charlotte on Wednesday.

And right now, it\u2019s all about life. Williams has stayed in contact with his players throughout this time of uncertainty, but to him, basketball is a secondary thought in these conversations. \u201cBasketball is important to us, but I\u2019m mindful that our guys have family members that could have been affected by this,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI lost a niece last week who had an underlying condition. We think the coronavirus was the culprit in taking it over the edge. She was pregnant. When I started to process that and think about what my in-laws were going through, I started thinking, our players are in the same situation. Privately, they could be going through something like that.\u201d Williams\u2019 message remains positive, as it always does, despite the adversity he has overcome in his life and the obstacles he\u2019s been left to battle with. He\u2019s taking the lessons that he has learned through the challenges he\u2019s faced to teach to his children with all that is going on in the world. \u201cI don\u2019t want to diminish how they feel,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBefore we all as a family went through the situation with their mom and my first wife, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been as aware to listen to my kids. Now, I want to listen to their fears and listen to what they\u2019re going through\u2026I have to be real with my kids. Life is precious. They know that. Yet, I have to remind them that they\u2019re blessed beyond what most people on the face of the Earth could imagine.\u201d Just as Williams is assisting his children during these difficult times in this country and around the world, Williams feels a similar obligation to his players. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to just check on them and let them know that I love them and care about them,\u201d Williams. \u201cBasketball just hasn\u2019t come up at all. Jevon Carter texted me yesterday saying he was going crazy because he couldn\u2019t hoop. So, I called him and we talked for a while. I just reminded him and myself that we\u2019ve always said as a team that this is a \u2018get to\u2019 and not a \u2018got to.\u201d Williams has always preached this phrase, reiterating the privilege of being in the NBA and how it should be looked at more of an honor than something deserved. In a time without basketball and without sports, it hits home a little harder. Every Tuesday, the Suns staff hold a conference call led by Williams and as much as they want to turn all their focus to basketball, they understand that\u2019s just not part of the bigger picture at the moment. \u201cWe talk about touching our guys in a personal way, knowing that we all want to play basketball and coach basketball, but our guys are dealing with stuff and we want to make sure we are sensitive to that,\u201d Williams said. Williams is now looking to share these messages he has relayed to his children, his staff and his players with the greater public. Someone who has consistently joked about the majority of social media networks has now officially joined Instagram in hopes to share his inspiring word with those struggling throughout the world. \u201cThe one way I could help give at all was to be an encouragement to people if I could,\u201d Williams. \u201cSo, I decided to get one of those pages and post some of the things that are important to me or things that have inspired me or given me some hope.\u201d As head coach, brand ambassador and Valley neighbor, Williams\u2019 focus is on the community around him as we strive to reach the other side of hard. \u201cWe are missing out on basketball, but we have each other,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe can text and call and pray and be there for one another and that is so important right now. We have not been defeated. Some of us have lost people, but we are not defeated. We are not out. We will get through this.\u201d "}

The newest Valley Chatz episode will debut on Sunday, April 19 at 6:30 p.m. (PT) on Suns.com/now and FOX Sports Arizona, the team\u2019s exclusive local television station, prior to \u201cSunsday\u201d at 7 p.m. Rubio and Bridges mentioned that, like most of us, they have spent plenty of time hanging out at home and enjoying a glass of wine while watching television. The Netflix drama Money Heist was a shared favorite, while both players acknowledged their anticipation for The Last Dance, ESPN\u2019s upcoming documentary about Michael Jordan during his final season with the Chicago Bulls. Rubio admitted that while he misses his teammates and the comradery in the training room, he\u2019s making a concerted effort to look on the bright side and see the good in each day. He has relished the opportunity to spend quality time with his family and watch his 3-month-old son, Liam, grow up right before his eyes. Rubio added that he\u2019s comforted by the way the global community has come together during this crisis, citing acts of kindness such as young kids offering to make grocery runs for the elderly, people doing whatever they can to make a kid\u2019s birthday special, and musicians putting on a show from their balcony to share their talent with their neighbors. \u201cIt\u2019s what we are here for,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cRight now, we are not in a good spot, but I think these little things that everybody is doing is helping to bring some light to the darkness.\u201d Bridges made an effort to brighten the days of medical staff here in the Valley last week when he provided 150 Chipotle burritos for frontline healthcare workers at Banner \u2013 University Medical Center Phoenix, where Leander\u2019s daughter works as a critical care nurse. Bridges also expounded upon on his new daily routine, which includes working out at home or going for a run and playing video games, like his teammate and NBA 2K Players Tournament champ Devin Booker. The new Valley Chatz episode includes a special appearance from 9-year-old Suns super fan and PayPal SixthMan Season Ticket Member Presley Fraley, who shared his tale of challenging Devin Booker to a game of 1-on-1 and his aspirations of one day joining the Sol Patrol dunk squad. Presley also had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ask Rubio and Bridges what it\u2019s like to be a member of the #ValleyBoyz movement. Fans are encouraged to check out Suns.com/now to discover upcoming Valley Chatz guests and submit questions for the discussion, providing a forum to glean insight from Suns and Mercury personalities about the things fans want to hear about. Tom Leander, along with Suns Digital &amp; Content Host and FOX Sports Arizona sideline reporter Lindsey Smith, will lead the conversations with special quests that will provide updates and commentary on a wide array of topics.

It was the morning of March 12th, less than 24 hours since the NBA had officially suspended their season and the feeling throughout Talking Stick Resort Arena couldn\u2019t be described as anything more than empty. While much larger concerns were rising throughout the world, the loss of sports, something that unites people in a way few others things can, was taken away as people began secluding themselves for their safety and the protection of others. Sports are common ground. Beyond race, religion, sexual orientation, age, etc., it provides a platform for people to drop their differences and come together as one, but in a time where people needed to join together more than ever, sports were no more.  There was a void that needed to be filled, an opportunity to provide even an ounce of joy and a distraction in these trying times and the Phoenix Suns social media team had an idea. \u201c[Social Media Senior Manager Allison Harissis] and the social team thought beyond traditional broadcast and what are other ways to give to fans,\u201d Suns Chief Marketing &amp; Communication Officer Dean Stoyer said. \u201cWe knew the sports world would take a timeout and how do we give everyone a way to continue to enjoy sports the best way.\u201d Harissis and the rest of the social team were in search of a way to keep fans entertained, provide a solution for their partners and unite Suns fans to stick together through all their current struggles. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to explore,\u201d Stoyer said. \u201cWe entered new territory and are looking at monetization, broader engagement, and partner integration. Those are the next steps.\u201d Their solution: continuing their season on the virtual hardwood through NBA 2K20 on Twitch. However, the Suns didn\u2019t have a Twitch channel, they had no professional gamers on call and they had less than 24 hours to get the whole program up and running. While the normal saying is, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen overnight\u201d, the Suns had no choice, but to make it happen overnight. \u201cWe worked through the night, Friday morning, and continued to amplify it,\u201d Harissis said. \u201cI appreciate people coming together and rallying behind us.\u201d The team partnered with Phoenix-based esports consulting agency SAK Gaming on the streaming front and brought in professional NBA2K player Antonio Saldivar, AKA UniversalPhe, as they worked quickly and efficiently to become the first team in professional sports to take this approach.  \u201cIf I didn't have the trust in [our social team and if I didn't know that they are hands down the best in the league, we wouldn't have moved as quickly as we did,\u201d Stoyer said. \u201cTheir instincts were right. We had to figure out a lot quickly. If we hesitated, if we waited, we wouldn't have been as successful.\" Prior to the season postponement, the Suns next game was scheduled for March 14th against the Dallas Mavericks. But instead, the Suns tipped-off virtually against the Mavericks on March 13 and made history in a time of uncertainty. The stream went viral. The game between Saldivar and Lawrence \u201cBuddy\u201d Norman drew over 221,000 views as the Suns followers on their newly-created Twitch channel jumped to 2,400. That was just the beginning though. \u201cThe results of the first Twitch stream have changed the conversation within the organization for the current and future context of how do we insert that into our overall strategy?\u201d Harissis said. Not only were Suns fans tuning in, but fans of all teams and all sports, eager to seek the thrill of a live game, began to watch, engage and breakdown the performances of the players, the teams and the overall stream. \u201cThe Suns were suddenly at the forefront of content creation for not just the NBA, but for all sports leagues that had delayed or canceled their seasons,\u201d Arda Ocal of ESPN.com wrote. \u201cMultiple teams have followed suit, but the Suns were certainly leading the charge.\u201d  There was excitement and the Suns wanted to build on that. While the season continued virtually on its regular schedule, the participants manning the controls began to rotate providing new fans and new experiences for each tip-off. The Suns joined forces with the gaming community as Saldivar was just one of many to take the controls for Phoenix. Curtis \u201cBud\u201d\u00a0Lane was a part of three of the most thrilling matches, including an overtime battle. \u201cIt was great working with the Suns,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI was able to see how an organization was run from the social media side of things. The social media team worked harder than many know. It felt like I was a part of an NBA organization. I wanted to do my best to represent the Suns in a positive way.\u201d While Lane is a professional gamer and makes his living in front of audiences on streams, the opportunity to work with the Suns was something he never thought he would experience and came as a surprise. \u201cI was shocked!,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I was getting a chance to represent an NBA organization multiple times. After two nail-biting games I was to able to finally bring home a win for the Suns. Seeing all of the tweets, comments, and replies really brought a smile to my face. The fans are passionate.\u201d The smile that Lane received in the process reflected what Valley sports fans were feeling as well as Lane assisted the Suns in bringing at least an ounce of sports back into the world. \u201cThe joy of bringing a version of basketball to fans across the world is so amazing to me,\u201d Lane said. \u201cTo have the fans root you on and seeing that the close games really had everyone on the edge of their seats made me want to do my best. I\u2019m hoping the fans enjoyed it as much as the players on the sticks. We know there is a void without sports. We we wanted to do our best.\u201d Professional gamers weren\u2019t the only avenue the Suns tapped into though. From Suns players such as Mikal Bridges, Ty Jerome, Frank Kaminsky and Tariq Owens to other Valley sports representatives like Brittney Griner, Chase Edmonds, Bryon Murphy Jr. and Owusu-Ansah Kontoh, the Suns branched out to different sports, different markets and different audience in order to provide a little something for everyone, not just Phoenix basketball fans. Suns Players:\u00a0Mikal Bridges (vs Matisse Thybulle), Ty Jerome (vs Josh Okogie), Frank Kaminsky III (vs Brian Bowen II), Tariq Owens (vs Darius Garland) Mercury:\u00a0Six-time WNBA All-Star and reigning WNBA scoring champion Brittney Griner (vs Jewell Loyd) #AllAZ:\u00a0Arizona Cardinals running back Chase Edmonds (vs Shaq Laweson) and cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. (vs Irv Smith Jr.), NFL safety and Suns fan Tony Jefferson (vs Keenan Allen), Phoenix Rising defender Owusu-Ansah Kontoh (vs Djordje Mihailovi\u0107) Fashion:\u00a0Sneakerhead Jacques Slade (vs Qias Omar) Professional 2K Gamers:\u00a0Curtis \u201cBud\u201d Lane, Antonio Saldivar Bridges, Jerome and Kaminsky given the opportunity to control themselves led to some classic lines throughout their streams as they battled with their virtual persona. Bridges: \u201cGive me three, \u2018kal!\u201d before he learns it was a long two-pointer and adds, \u201cget behind the line, bro!\u201d Kaminsky: \u201cOne-man fast break!\u201d before adding \u201coh man, I am slow\u201d Jerome: \u201cDunk that, Ty!\u201d before laughing as his virtual self attempt a layup on a wide-open look. While the steams were light-hearted and fun, the results were astonishing and went beyond what could have even been imagined. Through streaming on Facebook, Twitter and Twitch, the 17 games combined for a ground-breaking 7.9 million views, including 3.1M viewers for Jerome\u2019s matchup against Minnesota\u2019s Josh Okogie. At the conclusion of the final game, the Suns official Twitch channel gained 6,740 new total followers after starting from scratch just a few weeks prior. \u201cThat\u2019s how professional basketball looks under a national coronavirus lockdown as fans deprived of their favorite showdowns go online for a fix,\u201d Christina Settimi of Forbes.com wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another indication that the pandemic, while currently putting the global economy on ice, could be leading to massive shifts in consumer patterns and trends. Most of the fans watching were new\u2014specifically, 18-to-34-year-old affluent, digital-first fans. That\u2019s the holy grail for every graying sports league right now.\u201d Halfway through the virtual season, the Suns continued to elevate the Twitch experiment by continuing its partnership with 98.7 Arizona Sports to air the first-ever Twitch games on the radio with play-by-play man Jon Bloom and color analyst Tim Kempton calling the simulated action. \"It's been probably one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of this strange period that we're in,\" said Stoyer, the Suns' chief marketing and communications officer. \"Every week, we had responses from other teams and leagues asking us how we've been so successful.\" The concept of streams taking the current place of live sporting events has erupted to global scale, including ESPN hosting an all-player NBA 2K20 tournament in which some of the top stars of the NBA tipped-off on the virtual hardwood. The championship game ended up featuring the two Suns in the tournament in Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, with Booker walking away with the crown after finishing with a perfect record. \u201cWhile Devin Booker can now call himself the king of NBA 2K among NBA players, the Phoenix Suns can also lay claim to the content championship crown among franchises in the NBA and perhaps all of sports,\u201d Ocal said. In a time of fear with a future of uncertainty, any ounce of joy mixed with togetherness is needed to keep moving forward. And while from the outside these streams may just seem like video game simulations of reality, they have been able to provide Suns fans and sports fans from around the globe a glimpse of what they are striving for as they bond together during a time of distancing. \u201cYou find new ways to survive these moments and provide entertainment and distractions,\u201d Stoyer said. \u201cIf you look at it the right way, it shapes a new way of thinking.\u201d "}

His basketball success, his relationships with his players and his overall representation of the Suns organization hold him as one of the most iconic figures in franchise history. \u201cHe is somebody that is part of the DNA of the Phoenix Suns,\u201d NBA Hall of Famer Paul Westphal said. MacLeod began his career in 1967 at the University of Oklahoma where he coached fellow Suns Ring of Honor member Alvan Adams. \u201cHe started recruiting me when I was in 9th grade,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOne of the main reasons I chose the University of Oklahoma was because of John MacLeod.\u201d MacLeod spent six seasons as Oklahoma\u2019s head coach, three of them leading to top 20 ranks and only one below .500 (his second season). The success MacLeod shared with the Sooners soon caught the attention of then Suns owner Jerry Colangelo who was also serving as the team\u2019s head coach at the time in 1973. Colangelo was in a unique position where even though he was capable of coaching his team, he had the flexibility to bring in a potential coach and throw them right on the front lines. If the coach succeeded, he could bring them on board, if not, he had the option to continue as he was. \u201cI brought him into Phoenix and I actually had him at halftime make a presentation to our team,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cI wanted him to watch what he saw in the first half, come into our locker room and draw some diagrams, talk about some of the potential adjustments that we could make. He passed all of that with flying colors. Afterward, we had dinner and I offered him the job.\u201d  The 1973-74 season began the longest run by a head coach in franchise history. Not only did MacLeod begin to bring success on the court, but his personality went on display within his teachings. \u201cThe personal pronoun \u2018I\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist in the word team and we operate for the most part on that premise,\u201d said MacLeod. This wasn\u2019t just a coach\u2019s clich\u00e9, but a direct message he preached to his teams often in order for them to understand his style of play. \u201cHe loved the game,\u201d Westphal said. \u201cHe was totally professional and he was very fundamentally sound. The guys who played for him for very long were great teammates. He really valued team play and unselfishness.\u201d The players not only accepted his style of basketball, but embraced all that he was doing for them and their careers in order to get the most out of them. \u201cWhat a great, great person,\u201d Larry Nance said. \u201cJust a really good man. He\u2019d always put me in a situation to succeed on the basketball court.\u201d  That success came early and often for MacLeod and the Suns. \u201cWe had to pay our dues, he did, the first couple of years, but very quickly we got to the Finals,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThat was a fun time for us.\u201d In just his third season as the Suns coach, MacLeod turned the entire program around and made the Suns a true contender in the Western Conference. While there were bumps in the road early on in the season, MacLeod kept the teams focus looking forward and continued to make them believe in themselves. \u201cJohn MacLeod was a real motivator,\u201d Al McCoy said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget in that \u201975-76 season, with about 20 games in the season, we were playing a game in New Orleans. Dick Van Arsdale broke his wrist. The next morning, the team was leaving on the bus to continue on the road trip and it was a pretty down crew. John MacLeod, sensing that, got up on the bus and he told the bus driver, \u2018Pull off the freeway and find some place to park.\u2019 He went to every individual and he said, \u2018I know you\u2019re down. Van got hurt, we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be back, but what are we here for? Aren\u2019t we here to win? Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 So, every individual got up and they made a commitment that they were going to be a playoff team, that they could do it. As those things happen sometimes in sports, they did it.\u201d The team overcame all obstacles as MacLeod became the first coach in franchise history to lead the Suns to the NBA Finals. \u201cOh, it was a special time,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cFrom there we got better and better, stronger, more fuel, more fans, more support. It was a great year for the Suns.\u201d  MacLeod went on to compile a franchise-record 579 career wins, in addition to another franchise-record 37 playoff victories in his time with the Suns. The longest-tenured coach in team history (1973-87), MacLeod led the Suns for 13-plus seasons that included nine playoff berths, three Western Conference Finals appearances (1976, 1979, 1984) and, of course, the trip to the 1976 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. MacLeod will always be remembered as a member of the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor for his success on the court, his character off the court and the historic role he played in Suns franchise history. "}

They once again received an assist from the esports community as Curtis \u201cBud Lane\u201d returned to take control of the sticks for the Suns with Robert Flores representing the Rockets. After tightly-contested losses in his first two performances, Bud Lane wanted to prove early that he had what it took to run with the Suns, doing so against one of the top-ranked overall teams in the game. Bud Lane and the Suns went up by double-digits early in this one, but Flores and the Rockets battled back to bring it within just one at halftime. At the beginning of the game, Bud Lane said, \u201cGet Devin Booker going. That\u2019s the game plan.\u201d That strategy came to fruition in the second half as he started to feed the young All-Star early and often and his lead began to grow. After facing their only deficit in the third, the Suns overcame and entered the fourth with a nine-point advantage, but would need to close out strong to hold the Rockets off. Closing out strong put it lightly. Bud Lane, Booker and the rest of the Suns dominated throughout the entirety of the fourth quarter, outscoring the Rockets 24-12 in the final period. The Rockets remained in striking distance, trailing 58-51 with 7:54 left before the Suns broke the game open with a 20-4 run to take a 78-55 lead with 2:53 remaining. Booker caught fire, scoring 16 of the Suns\u2019 final 18 points over this 20-4 stretch. Booker totaled 16 fourth-quarter points; in NBA play this season, he has nine quarters scoring 16-plus points, tied for sixth-most in the league. The Suns handled business in H-Town as they ultimately defeated the Rockets 85-61. Big road wins against playoff teams are not limited to the 2K court for the Suns this season. On the actual hardwood, the Suns have beat the Jazz in Salt Lake City by 20 points (131-111) on Feb. 24 and the Mavericks in Dallas by 29 points (133-104) on Jan. 28. This is the first season in Suns team history they have record multiple road wins of 20-plus points against teams at least 10 games above .500. The\u00a0winner of the NBA 2K Players Tournament, Booker proved he\u2019s just as good on the court, with the sticks in his hands or as his virtual self. Booker scored a team-high 26 points on 11-of-22 shooting in addition to five assists. In NBA games this season, Booker has 20 games with at least 25 points and five assists on 50% shooting\u2014only LeBron James has more. The biggest difference in the game came on the glass. The Suns outrebounded the small-ball Rockets 36-24, including 17-7 on offensive boards, with much of that coming from the Big Fella. Deandre Ayton finished the game with 19 rebounds to go along with his 14 points and 2 blocks. In NBA games this season, Ayton has three games with 19-plus rebounds, tied for sixth-most in the league despite the fact he has been limited to 30 games. The Suns shot a perfect 13-of-13 from the free throw line\u2014in actual NBA games played this season, the Suns lead the league by shooting 82.6%, the best free throw percentage in franchise history.

Scoring a career-high 49 points, to go with 14 rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block, the big man converted 17 of his 24 field goal attempts, and shot a near-perfect 14-for-15 from the foul stripe. Postgame, there was plenty of talk about the All-Star. Here\u2019s some of what was said\u2026 Brett Brown was proud of Embiid\u2019s holistic game, and gave him props for adapting: \u201cHe was dominant. He was dominant making his free throws. He was dominant as an interior presence. Scoring that volume of points at that efficient of a rate is impressive. I thought the thing that doesn\u2019t show up on the stat sheet that he did as well as anything was that he handled the double teams. Whether he passed out of it because there was a crowd, whether he went quick because the double teams were coming and he didn\u2019t get involved in that. I thought he handled the double teams really well.\u201d In the fourth quarter, Embiid fired back for 22 points. In the absence of Ben Simmons (back), Brown expressed his appreciation for Embiid\u2019s relentless effort and sharp mindset: \u201cWith the news of Ben and him not being there, it\u2019s clear to him that he\u2019s gotta come out. He\u2019s gotta play like he did tonight, for the most part. His mentality is what most impressed me. We saw the same thing against Brooklyn. We\u2019re all going to point to the numbers. The bottom line is this: when he comes out with that activity, that energy, that mentality, he makes a statistician work and we will win a lot of games.\u201d Embiid himself reiterated that his mindset has changed of late. Monday night was no exception. \u201cI said it right before All-Star break that I was going to have a different mindset and it wasn\u2019t just about tonight. Since the Clippers game, I\u2019ve had the mindset of just being aggressive just trying to dominate offensively and defensively. I said I was going to get back to having fun, but having fun comes in different forms. I don\u2019t always have to be smiling or laughing all the time. I can have fun just dominating the game. Obviously, tonight was just one of those nights where I was having fun like the old days, just having fun with the crowd. Some nights, I just want to dominate and stay quiet, but it was cool. Most important thing is that we bounced back and we got the win.\u201d Listen to a recap of Joel Embiid's career performance on the 76ers Podcast Network After a tough loss to the Bucks in Milwaukee Saturday, Embiid added that perseverance and staying cool through the ebbs and flows of the season will be key as the home stretchn progresses. \u201cWe can\u2019t get too high and we can\u2019t get too low. Like I always say, you\u2019re going to make shots some nights, you\u2019re going to miss them some nights. Tonight, I did make some. The other night, bad night to go cold, but I missed some, so it was a bad game. Tonight, I had a better game, so I\u2019m just going to keep being steady and just keep trying to gradually get better. We play again in two nights, so we move on. Everybody\u2019s going to forget about tonight. The other night, we moved on and we\u2019ve got to get another win.\u201d Tobias Harris, who had another impressive outing himself (25 pts, 6 reb, 4 ast, 1 stl, 1 blk), applauded Embiid\u2019s big night too: \u201cI think you saw him go out there tonight and impose his will\u2026I just think he did a really good job of picking the game apart from the beginning. He saw the double-team and kicked it out really fast a couple of times and adjusted to how they were sending the double-teams. He went quick on a lot of his post-ups, and he kind of really picked the game apart from the low block and found a lot of different ways to get going tonight. He was dominant.\u201d Across the hall in Hawks\u2019 territory, former Sixer assistant and current Hawks Head Coach Lloyd Pierce discussed Embiid\u2019s growth since their time together in Philadelphia: \u201cHe\u2019s just a smarter player. He knows how to attack against a double team a little bit better. He\u2019s low with the duck-ins, he\u2019s using his size and his physicality a lot more, and tonight he was really tough on the offensive glass, just cleaning up a lot of missed shots, especially when we were scrambling and rotating.\u201d The Sixers head to Cleveland Tuesday for the first night of a back-to-back on Wednesday.

After winning the first two games of the series in Portland and Game 4 in Oklahoma City, the Trail Blazers returned home with a chance to close out the series a year after being unceremoniously swept out of the first round of the 2018 Playoffs. The following is an oral history of the fourth quarter of that game, as told by six Trail Blazers, which would culminate with Damian Lillard hitting the second playoff-series ending three-pointer of his career and Portland winning 118-115 to advance to the second round.   After losing 120-107 in Game 3, the first meeting of the series in Oklahoma City, the Trail Blazers returned to form in Game 4, besting the Thunder relatively easily with a 111-98 victory at Chesapeake Energy Arena. By taking the first two games at the Moda Center and splitting the next two games in Oklahoma City, the Trail Blazers returned to Portland with a 3-1 lead and a chance to close out the series in Game 5. Damian Lillard, Trail Blazers point guard: \"I remember we came back from Oklahoma City, 3-1 lead and I just remember coming home like, not only do we have three more chances to win one game, but I was like alright, we in a great spot, three chances to win one game, two of those games at home. But I was like, after our performance last year, I really wanted a certified matchup in that first round, so we not only would be able to redeem ourselves, but it would be against a tough matchup where people thought we would lose, you know? So in my mind, I was like, alright, we going home for Game 5, we can beat these dudes 4-1, that would be a great turnaround, you know what I'm saying? Not only would it be a first-round victory, it would be dominance over them. A team that swept us during the regular season and talked trash, everybody picked them to beat us. I was like, this a chance to really show dominance over them in this series. \"Just finish them off at home, this is what has to happen. That was my thought process. Don't just think, alright, this gonna be cool, they gonna go away. Let's come out here to really show dominance over them.\"  An exciting Game 4 win on the road, but still work to be done. #RipCity | #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/SOR2XejM32 \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 23, 2019  Zach Collins, Trail Blazers power forward/center: \"We wanted to end it, we didn't want to go back to Oklahoma City. We didn't want to be on that flight, that windy flight, that sketchy flight, we just wanted to end the series. We knew that we could have ended it in OKC but they got hot and they won a game. In the playoffs when you lose it's really tough because it matters so much, but when we lost that game, the locker room was just very upbeat. We were like, alright, they got one but we know we're the better team, we know that we know how to play them better than they know how to play us. We were just really confident, honestly... Us feeling confident after a loss is not the same as them feeling confident after a win.\" To state the obvious: the Trail Blazers were undoubtably the overwhelming favorite to move on to the second round after coming back to Portland with a 3-1 lead. But after entering the 2019 NBA Playoffs having lost their previous eight postseason contests, a run they were often reminded of and which included an embarrassing sweep the year before at the hands of the New Orleans Pelicans, no one wanted to assume that advancing was a given, especially against a team that had taken the regular season series 4-0. Moe Harkless, former Trail Blazers forward: \"Honestly, me personally, I hadn't thought about that Pelicans series. Once the playoff started, I'm not thinking about that series anymore because we have another series to worry about. So for me personally, at that point, I'm thinking we need to win this next game and get this series over with so we can rest. That was my mindset: Let's win this game, win the series right now, let's not let this thing drag on any longer than it should. \"Besides just going back to OKC and nobody wants to be there, it's actually a tough place to play. So if you don't have to go back there, you don't want to.\" Zach Collins: \"I think when we found out we had to play OKC and that we had lost to them -- I think we lost to them every time we played them in the regular season. I think that thought crept in about, damn, we haven't beat them yet, so going up against them in the first round, we can't get swept again. It's a horrible look but also just as competitors, we just can't let it happen. I think that thought was there but I don't think we used it as motivation, I just think that was in the back of our heads as far as we hadn't beat them yet. But at the same time, we also believed that we were in every game that we lost to them, so we knew we were two or three plays away from taking the lead against them in every game we played them, so that was a bit of comfort. But we were just really confident and it started with Dame. Dame was so pumped up to play them and he really instilled that confidence in all of us.\" Anfernee Simons, Trail Blazers guard: \"I\u2019m a rookie, I\u2019m not gonna bring it up because I wasn\u2019t here, but they talked about it a lot, what they learned from it. You could tell that, during the playoffs, they did not want to be that team that kept getting swept in the first round. It played a factor in the run we made. \"   After a day off, the Trail Blazers are set to host the the Thunder on Tuesday, April 23 at the Moda Center, and behind 15 points from Paul George, the Thunder go up by as many as 10 points in the the first quarter. While Damian Lillard did George a bit better, going for 19 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the field, 3-of-4 shooting from three and 4-of-6 shooting from the free throw line, no other Trail Blazer scored more than two points through the first 12 minutes, resulting in the Thunder taking a 37-29 lead into the second quarter. But while Lillard kept up his scoring in the second -- he had 15 points to give him 34 in the first half -- George played just over half the quarter while scoring just five points. Meanwhile, Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook struggled from the field, going 2-of-11 from the field and 1-of-5 from three for five points in just under nine minutes. Between Lillard's continued assault on Oklahoma City's defense and Seth Curry (seven points) Moe Harkless (four points) and Enes Kanter (five points, seven rebounds and two assists) all increasing their offensive production, the Blazers outscored the Thunder by 11 in the second quarter to take a 61-60 lead into the halftime break. After the two teams took turns holding small leads to start the second half, the Blazers went on a 9-0 run, capped by a Lillard 26-foot three-pointer, to take their largest lead of the game at 84-75 with 3:29 to play in the third quarter. Oklahoma City coach Billie Donovan called timeout after the three, and at that point, it seemed as though the Blazers might be on the verge of blowing the game open.  We are all witnesses. New playoff career high 42 for @dame_lillard pic.twitter.com/xJrmCpAQEJ \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 24, 2019  Damian Lillard: \"I remember I hit a three in front of they bench to put us up nine and they called a timeout. And I remember thinking at that point, if we don't just step on them right now and put them away, because it was like, the game started off in their favor and then we come fight our way back -- I think I had like 34 in the first half (ed note: Lillard is correct) -- and then in the third quarter we kind of took control. After I hit that three I remember we took a nine-point lead, maybe like 84-75 or something like that (ed note: correct again). I hit the three and I remember walking to the bench like, okay, that was a good timeout. I literally remember thinking 'Damn, that was a good timeout!' because I felt like if they didn't call a timeout right there, we would have went up 13 or 15 or something. I was like, right now the crowd is in it, we doing the right things, I just felt like we was about to go up 15 and they called a timeout and I was like 'Damn.'\" Zach Collins: \"I think the fact that Dame was just going nuts was huge for us as well. Any time you're up that late in the game, you're feeling very good about it, you're feeling like, okay now we're in a position where we just have to hold on to it. We're not in a position where we have to fight to get back into the game, so we felt really good.\" CJ McCollum: \"I felt great! It was like, this is exactly how we pitched it, you know? Put 'em away, win by double digits, easy flowing game. I had been in foul trouble so I was in and out of the game, but I was just thinking, this is great! I'm in foul trouble, we're still keeping it close, Dame just going bananas, everybody is playing well and we're in a position to get out of here and get to the next round.\" Damian Lillard: \"So we get to the bench and I remember thinking, if they come out of this timeout and we don't continue where we were before this timeout, it's gonna become a dogfight.\" That's exactly what happened. Behind three-pointers from George, Westbrook and Jerami Grant, the Thunder closed out the third quarter on a 15-4 run to take a 90-88 lead into the fourth quarter. And it only got worse for the Trail Blazers. Portland would score just two points in the first four minutes and fifteen seconds of the fourth while Oklahoma City steadily expanded their lead. By the 7:45 mark of the fourth, the Thunder led by 15 thanks to a 30-6 run going back to the 3:10 mark of the third quarter. At that point, it seemed likely that the Trail Blazers would be heading back to Oklahoma City for Game 6. Damian Lillard: \"They came out, obviously took that lead, Schroder hit some shots, Paul George had a great game that night, Russ had a great game that night.\" Moe Harkless: \"In the playoffs, you can't really let yourself go there because, shit, you know, we played Golden State three years in a row, we were up probably 80 percent of the time on the floor (laughs). At that point it's the same kind of mentality because you know they're going to go on a run eventually. Not necessarily take the lead, but they're gonna put pressure on us, so we've just got to stay focused. And they did, they came back and they took the lead.\" Zach Collins: \"I remember that being just an avalanche, everything just went wrong in that timespan for us and everything was going right for them. They were hitting everything. I think as a team, it was like, oh shit, this isn't going to be easy. They went on their run, now we're in a position where we have to go fight back into this game and win this game because none of us want to go back to OKC 3-2 because we're going back and now they've won two games and they're feeling super confident at home in a tough arena, so we knew we couldn't let that game slip away.\" Jusuf Nurki\u0107, Trail Blazers center: \"I was feeling great watching on the couch. At some point when we was leading I was like, great, but then a couple minutes later, a lot of things changes.\"   After making something of a habit of going down double digits, only to come away with a win during the 2018-19 regular season, the Trail Blazers felt as though there was still plenty of time to make a game of it. Whether it was confidence born out of previous experience, the assumption that a team featuring Damian Lillard was never really out of it, the fact that they'd still have two games to win one even if they dropped Game 5 or some combination of those factors, Portland didn't seem especially rattled by Oklahoma City's advantage. Damian Lillard: \"I remember when we got down 15, I was just like, the game don't feel bad, you know what I'm saying? I had it rolling so much that I was like, the game don't feel bad. I feel like we gonna dig out of it. I feel like this is what we have to do to get that type of performance in this series, to really wrap it up, this is what we gotta dig out of. Fifteen-point deficit, we gotta be on our shit. I feel like it wasn't just me that was thinking that and I think the way we played backed that up.\" Moe Harkless: \"I think that was kind of a testament to that team. We never felt like we were out of it, period. Playoff race, the game, we never felt like we were out of anything. When we went down, I won't say we weren't worried, but we weren't nervous. We were just locked in and focused on the task at hand. We're down now, there's this much time, we know we can beat this team so let's go out here and do it.\" CJ McCollum: \"Doubt always creeps in but you've got to put it away. You can't verbalize it and allow that to effect your mentality. Obviously I was thinking we just tricked off a nice lead, we had a chance to win this going away and now we're about to be in a dogfight. We didn't score for a while, we were out there kind of going back and forth and I think Russell Westbrook or something hit a three and you look up and you're like 'Wow.' Up 15 with nine minutes left, so I was like 'Oomph, we got a lot of work to do, just try to get one stop at a time.'\" Zach Collins: \"It was definitely an 'our backs to the wall' situation because we realized we're in real trouble if we go back to OKC and they force a Game 7. We didn't want to mess around with it, Dame was very vocal in the huddle, I think all of us were really vocal about it. We were super tight and like, we can't give up right now because it'll be detrimental to us, but we were never not confident. We never thought they were the better team, we knew we were the better team, but at that moment, they had gone on a crazy run. We just stayed in it, never gave up.\" Damian Lillard: \"We had already felt the bottom (the year before versus the Pelicans), you know what I'm saying? Like, the bottom. And we had felt the pressure, we had already went through it. So there wasn't no panic and none of that. We also, from top to bottom on our team, we honestly felt like we had they number. We had beaten them three out of four, even the games they beat us in the regular season, we was on they ass.\" Shortly after the Thunder took the largest lead of the game at 107-92, McCollum and Harkless checked in for Seth Curry and Rodney Hood, and almost immediately, the flow of the game changed. McCollum, who entered the fourth with just seven points on 3-of-11 shooting from the field and 1-of-6 shooting from three, netted a floater on one end and blocked a Schroder shot on the following possession. CJ McCollum: \"I was struggling man. I was struggling big time. From a rhythm standpoint to game flow to everything, but I know who I am as a player. I think that's the biggest thing: I know who I am and I have a lot of confidence in my abilities, regardless of circumstances. I always feel like, with me, the next shot is going in and the next shot is a good shot, especially if I can create space.\" Damian Lillard: \"I was telling (McCollum) the whole game 'You're going to come up big, stay with it' and all that. I was on his line talking to him like that. And he was like 'Just keep going, I'm going to be there with you in the end, I got you.' He just kept saying that, 'I got you,' and I just told him we gonna get it done. That's what I love the most about C is he don't waiver, his confidence is always there. He not gonna stop being CJ, it's almost like a little arrogance, you know?\" As for Harkless, with the Thunder opting to throw double teams at Lillard, the 6-9 forward out of St. John's found multiple opportunities to score, getting three dunks over the course of two minutes after checking in midway through the fourth. Moe Harkless: \"I remember Russ was guarding me for a long period of time and he was just kind of helping a lot, so I was just going to get rebounds, try to find little seams behind the defense whenever he would turn his head. Dame and CJ demand so much attention when they're on the floor, especially in the playoffs, you gotta be able to find ways to be effective around them. They were able to find me getting out in transition, they were able to find me making some cuts and offensive rebounding. Those were things in that series especially that I was able to do to help the team.\" Another thing Harkless was able to do to help the team, at least in Game 5, was hit clutch, high-pressure free throws. A 61 percent career free throw shooter in both the regular season and post season, Harkless went 1-of-6 from the line through three first three quarters of Game 5. But in the fourth, Harkless went 4-of-4 on two trips to the line, one with just over four minutes to play and the other with one minute, 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Damian Lillard: \"That was the most I had ever seen him locked in the whole series. So when he went to the line, I wasn't worried. I had a lot of confidence in Moe, his demeanor and his focus and his comments, everything that he had about him in that whole playoff, I felt good about it.\" Zach Collins: \"You know what's funny, we were all like... he was missing all game. He was missing all game, so when he went to the line we were all kind of... we had full confidence in him but we were like, if we go based off what's happened so far, he's probably going to miss these. But he went and hit 'em. I think that was an underrated part of that game, for sure.\" CJ McCollum: \"There was no doubt in my mind he was going to make those free throws. He was the unsung hero of that game, he basically shifted the entire game, especially after starting off 1-of-6 at the free throw line to just calmly step up and knock it down. They was drawls.\" Moe Harkless: \"I'm not always the best free throw shooter, but when it's winning time, it's winning time (laughs). \"Let me tell you something, make sure you quote me on this: I'm a 50 percent shooter from everywhere. Either it's going to go in, or it's going to go out (laughs). I'm a 50 percent shooter from everywhere! There's only two things that can happen: either that bitch gonna go in or I'll miss. Every time I shoot, 50 percent. \"On a serious note, I didn't think about that. I was out there, I just knew I had to make one free throw at a time and that'll put us in a better position to win.\"   Even with the game trending in their direction, the Trail Blazers were still down eight with less than four minutes to play. But they'd get a boost from the arrival of Jusuf Nurki\u0107, who suffered two compound fractures in his left leg in an overtime win versus the Brookyln Nets at the Moda Center a little less than a month prior to Game 5. Nurki\u0107, whose play in the regular season was one of the foremost reasons Portland was able to nab the three-seed, had not been seen in public since the injury and had not attended either of the previous two games in Portland, let alone the two meetings in Oklahoma City. But with his team struggling, Nurki\u0107 decided to make his return to the Moda Center in hopes of doing whatever he could to help his teammates. Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"Basically what happened -- I don't remember the minutes, I feel like three or four minutes to go in the third quarter or even less -- I'm like, man, should I go there? I texted my doctor like 'I got a crazy idea in my mind, should I do it?' and he's like 'No Nurk, don't do it!' I'm sitting and like, I was just texting the doc, I just can't help. He's like 'You good, you ain't gonna do anything but it's just not worth the risk.' \"So at that point, my girlfriend was walking by, so I ask her 'How long you need to get ready?' She turn back to me and was like 'Get ready or just dressed?' so at that point, I was like 'Get ready.' Basically she got ready and I put some clothes on as comfortable I could find and I drive. I forgot I still need like 25 minutes, at least, to the Moda Center. I basically drive there and I was like, whatever happens, happens, I'm going to just meet them in locker room. But when I arrive it was like, two minute or three minutes to go or something like that and we 10 down or something like that. So I'm like, I'm already here, I'm going out. All the emotions and stuff, just can't stay in the locker room.\" Nurki\u0107, wearing a custom screen-printed \"WestBRICK\" shirt that a friend gave to him a few days before, walked to Portland's bench during a timeout with 3:28 to play in regulation, much to the surprise of his teammates and coaches. Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"No one saw me! How perfect was the timeout came, so when I was walking in, it was timeout. I go to the huddle and I put my arm around Chief and he didn't realize I was there until the end of the timeout. Chief turn to me, we make hands together and stuff, Chief turned like 'What the (expletive)? Where you come from?' I'm like 'Don't ask me anything man. We just need to win this game.'  pic.twitter.com/0GJ9SPWXSX \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 24, 2019  CJ McCollum: \"I was like 'What the (expletive) is he doing here?' You know what I mean? 'Where did you come from?' I was thinking 'You've been here this whole time?' (laughs). He came at the perfect time, honestly, because everyone was kind of, not out, but definitely down. We weren't down and out, but we were down, like \"Dang, we just blew it, blew a nice lead and it's not looking good. \"I was happy to see Nurk, he was like 'Come on, win this game,' giving us confidence and inspiring us and cheering us on. Surely enough, the crowd loved it, they got hyped, standing ovation and that shifted the entire game from a momentum standpoint.\" Zach Collins: \"I had no idea he was going to come, I didn't know that he was even going to be at the arena. I remember watching the game or looking at something -- I wasn't looking at where Nurk was walking out of -- but I was looking at something and then the crowd just starts screaming. I'm like 'What the hell is going on?' and then I turn around and Nurk is right next to us. Then we see him on the screen nodding his head, getting the crowd super hyped. As corny as it sounds, that was definitely something that helped us. \"To have him there -- Nurk really knows how to get the crowd going and yelling. We weren't out of it mentally but that gave us an energy boost. Everybody felt it, everyone was like 'Nurk's with us, we can do this' even though he's not playing. That was awesome. Everything with his injury and how huge he was for our team, everybody knows that. He's definitely one of our emotional leaders. We look to him when he's on the court, we always get that boost because he's not afraid of anything. Obviously for the crowd to see that and for us to see that, it was big.\" Fans at the Moda Center realized, thanks to some quick work from the Trail Blazers game ops, that Nurki\u0107 was on the Portland bench at roughly the 3:22 mark of the fourth. At the time, the Thunder were leading 113-105, though they would score only once in the remainder of the game after Nurki\u0107's arrival.   Lillard's end of game heroics would eventually seal the game, though it was a run of smaller plays that occurred with less than two minutes play, along with the arrival of Nurki\u0107, that allowed Portland to eventually make up a 15-point deficit to tie the game with just over a minute to play. There was Damian Lillard taking a charge on Russell Westbrook with 1:55 to play in regulation. Damian Lillard: \"David Vanterpool kept telling us 'He gonna keep forcing it!' The later it get in the game, he was just saying he's not gonna want to lean on his jumpshot, he gonna start trying to get downhill. And he was like 'Somebody gotta step in there and take a charge on him' and the whole game he had been saying it. At that point in the game, I was like, I might as well stand here. If he throw it out and my man hit a three, yeah, I'm staying in. I'm just gonna stay in for it, we needed possessions. So I just stayed in and took it, turned out to be a big play.\" Then it was McCollum's turn. The Lehigh grad canned a floater to cut Oklahoma City's lead to 113-109 on the possession after Westbrook was called for a charge. And after a steal by Seth Curry, two possessions later, McCollum hit a 22-foot pullup over the outstretched hands of Paul George to tie the game at 113-113 with 57 seconds to play. CJ McCollum: \"I knew for us to win that I would have to play well -- I think I started off very poorly but I think I had 15 or something in the second half (ed. note: CJ is correct). I hit a floater, I banked one right baseline, had a floater left baseline. \"I was actually trying to pass the ball to Dame, he was killing all night and they were denying him, face guarding him and kind of pushing the catch toward halfcourt and I didn't want to risk getting a turnover, so I was just like, just have to go one-on-one. I sized him up, I wasn't shooting well from three so I knew I wasn't shooting a three, I knew I was going to shoot a midrange shot. Went left to right crossover and he jumped and I was like 'Oh, I have to shoot this.' I shot it and I thought I shot it kind of strong, so I kind of went forward a little bit. I was like, that's a little long but it's on target. Sure enough, it was drawls and I was like 'Looks like that's going to be game!'\" But not just yet. George answered McCollum's tough jumper with one of his own, giving the Thunder their first field goal in over three minutes of play and a two-point lead with 39.4 seconds left in the fourth. On the next possession, Damian Lillard drives straight down the lane, passing Denis Schroder and floating in between Paul George and Jerami Grant to finish with a layup that ties the game at 115-115 with 32.8 seconds to play. Damian Lillard: \"Then they finally scored -- Paul George hit a two-pointer and put them up two, but we had the two for one, so when Coach called a timeout I was like, they're not gonna want to foul me, so I know I'm going to be able to get downhill and if there's any contact up top, I'm pretty sure they're going to blow the whistle in this situation because even if I got to the line for two, the refs won't feel bad because OKC is going to have the last shot, even if it's like minimal contact. So I was like, I feel like if I go in there and challenge them, just force it downhill, I feel like they not gonna really go after it, because they're expecting me to look for contact. And all of the dudes just jumped up and tried to put they hands up, they didn't really contest the shot and I just laid it up over all of them. And we got the two-for-one. \"I knew I was around Denis Schroder, and usually when I'm attacking the paint, I know that I'm gonna end up with a good angle when a defender step up, and they all step towards me and I was going towards the basket, so I knew I would be able to glide past them... And once I came out, I just did what I always do in my workouts. Phil (Beckner) always telling me 'Keep your eyes on the rim, keep your eyes up, watch the ball go in.' I just had my eyes up, my eyes were up early -- like when I picked the ball up I had my eyes up -- and I just made sure I didn't have a lazy finish, just kind of toss it up there expecting it to go in. I finished high, I had my arm extended, had my eyes on the rim early, I exploded to the rim. I made sure that I was sharp on that possession.\" Russell Westbrook attempts a similar approach on what would be Oklahoma City's final possession of the postseason. But Al-Farouq Aminu stays in front of Westbrook, absorbs contact and is able to get his arms up to contest the off balance layup and collect the rebound for Portland with 17.1 seconds to go. Damian Lillard: \"Chief stuck his hands out, came up with the rebound.\" Zach Collins: \"I always hear that narrative about how people wanted more from Moe or Chief or whatever. It's different when you're with them everyday and you see the work they put in and you see how smart they are and you see when we have a gameplan defensively and how well they execute it and how much they help other guys on the court play defense. You don't really give all that noise all that much credit. I don't want to say I wasn't surprised when they made those plays, it's always amazing, especially in those big moments, because not a lot of people in the league can do what those guys do on both sides of the floor. It was just fun to watch. You get close to those guys so you're always really happy for them when things go their way, especially with all that noise. It was just awesome, and we needed to get stops in that game, for sure. We knew, at the end of the day, Dame was having a big game and we could score, but defensively, we needed to really lock down, so it was big.\"   Aminu hands the ball to Lillard after the rebound. Lillard quickly dribbles the ball past halfcourt, but slows once he reaches the pinwheel logo. With Paul George getting into his defense stance a few feet away, Lillard surveys the court while taking slow, methodical dribbles with with roughly 10 seconds to play and the score tied 115-115. Damian Lillard: \"Once I got the ball, I was bringing it up, I looked at the clock and I was like, let me just see where I could get to where (George) is going to still be backed off of me. So I dribbled up, I stopped -- he was kind of looking around, he was backing up -- and I was like, the clock was winding down, I'm not going to the rim, they not gonna call nothing right now to decide the game. So I was like, 'I'm just gonna shoot this shit from right here.'\" CJ McCollum: \"I'm expecting him to drive to the basket! I'm like, game is tied, cool. I didn't even know he had 47. If I knew he had 47 I would have known he was shooting a three. I didn't know. You know how you just get lost in the game? So I'm just lost in the game, running up and down the court and I actually sprint down the left side then I looked and I was like, ah damn, there's nobody on the right side, lemme go over here just for spacing purposes so we got three on one side and one on the other. I do that and I'm watching him and he's just dribbling, he's just taking his time and I'm like 'Bruh, go!'\" Moe Harkless: \"The game was tied, Chief get the rebound, we're running up the court. The game is tied, there's no shot clock, so I think everybody in the arena knew Dame was going to shoot, right? So he's standing at halfcourt, clock is ticking, seven seconds, six seconds, five seconds. I'm like 'Okay, five seconds, he's got to go now, right?' Five seconds, he doesn't go, three seconds, he doesn't go, I'm like 'What the (expletive) is this guy about to do?' cause he's standing at halfcourt!'\" Zach Collins: \"I had no idea, I had opinions. I thought he was going to go to his stepback, but then he was so damn far away, I was like, I don't know what he's doing. I thought maybe he's going to get a running start and he's gonna do a couple moves and go to the rim. Honestly, when he kept dribbling it out there so far, I didn't know what he was doing. I didn't know if he was gonna try to get a foul, like a pumpfake, I didn't know what he was going to do. And then it got to a point where his only option was to just to shoot and I was like 'Shit, he's just gonna launch it.'\" Anfernee Simons: \"By the way he was dribbling, I kind of figured he was pulling up for three. We worked out together a bunch of times last year so I\u2019ve seen him shoot that shot, or some form of that shot, a hundred times. I wasn\u2019t worried about him missing it.\" After getting square with the basket, Lillard dribbles the ball right to left, left to right. As time is winding down, Paul George takes a step toward Lillard right as he shifts the ball back to his right hand. Lillard collects, takes a small step to the right to improve his angle and raises up from 37 feet with 1.8 seconds on the clock. CJ McCollum: \"I think I waved at him like 'Go!' As soon as I wave for him to drive or do something, he takes like a methodical dribble, side step and just raises up and I'm like 'Oh shit, he shot it.'\" Moe Harkless: \"At first I'm like, let me try to position myself to get an offensive rebound but then I'm like okay, it's two seconds, now I've just got to watch. Side steps to the right and (expletive) just shoots.\" Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"As soon as he waved off, I know he's coming long range because he will not take chances to gamble with referee, they gonna call foul or they not. I feel like he gonna get clear shot but I definitely didn't feel he was going to take stepback from there.\" Zach Collins: \"And when he launched it, it's one of those shots where, if it goes in, it's an amazing shot and if it doesn't go in, you're kind of scratching your head like, why didn't he move closer or why didn't he get to where he can hit that shot? But you forget a lot of times, there's special dudes in this league who make shots that nobody else but them can make. You've seen Dame shoot that shot so many times, but not from that distance, but like he said after, he's been working on that at night at the facility, getting extra shots up and he was working on those far-ass stepbacks.\"  M V P  pic.twitter.com/iu9Rz77UyQ \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 24, 2019  The ball leaves Lillard's hand, traveling almost half the distance of the court while over 20,000 in the Moda Center and millions of people around the world watch in anticipation. The ball hits the inside back of the rim and caroms through the net just as time expires, giving the Portland Trail Blazers a 118-115 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder while ending the first round series 4-1. Damian Lillard: \"He stepped up to me a little bit, so then I kind of started dribbling between the legs because I just wanted to get him to move to my left a little bit so I could step back right away from him and shoot the shot I wanted to shoot. And when I went between the legs, he just took a small step to my left and he was flatfooted and I had the little bit of space that I needed. Game.\" CJ McCollum: \"The ball traveled in slow motion and then it was like, swish, goes in buzzer goes off and I'm like, 'Oh shit, he made it!' And then I forgot that, oh, that's game! That's the series! You kind of forget, you're like, damn that's a crazy shot.\" Moe Harkless: \"It felt like the ball was in the air for 15 seconds and then it's straight cash and everybody just goes crazy. It was wild. That was probably the most electrifying basketball moment that I've been a part of.\" Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"I see a lot of stuff what's happening in game but in that period of time, especially with the energy we have and the boost, we came back from 15 and all momentum was on our side, so I feel like him taking that shot was just putting cherry on dessert. Just everything kind of fell in. I was really glad I was there for that moment.\" Zach Collins: \"He did it. He worked on it. He wasn't throwing up a prayer, he knew in his mind what shot he was going to get. He probably knew in his mind right when he got the ball that that was the shot he was going to take. Pretty incredible.\" In one of the most iconic moments in franchise history, Lillard, stone-faced after hitting the shot and ending the series, waves to the Oklahoma City bench right before he is mobbed by his teammates and brother, Houston, and sister, LaNae, who were sitting courtside just a few feet away.  Dame. Called. Game. pic.twitter.com/8Z0skeDbZE \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 24, 2019  Damian Lillard: \"In the playoffs, I always have my brother and my dad or my brother and my sister courtide, always got two tickets courtside. And it was funny because I was dribbling the ball up and when I was standing there dribbling, I heard my brother yelling. It was like he just knew, like he felt what was about to happen or something. And then when I look at it on tape, I see him look up to the scoreboard and then I see him lean his head back and that was when he was yelling. If you look at it, you see him look up and then he starts yelling and when I was dribbling I actually heard him because he was so close to me. I actually heard him yelling. He was damn near the first person to me.\"   A dogpile ensues in the celebration across from Portland's bench. Enes Kanter and Skal Labissiere, two of the largest players on the team, get to Lillard first, after which the rest of the roster arrives either to jump on the pile or make sure nobody gets injured at the bottom of it. With the team, his family and a number of fans sitting courtside entangled together, Lillard delivers another iconic moment by looking up at the camera from the dogpile and calmly nodding his head, thus creating a meme that is a part of the regular rotation on social media. Damian Lillard: \"Any time you see a dogpile around me, don't get nervous because I don't let nobody dogpile me. If you see the first time I hit the shot against the Rockets they tried it, I was pulling people off of me before it could happen. And this time, I was just kind of grabbing people to make sure I didn't go down underneath all of them. I ain't gonna be at the bottom of no dogpile. You can count on that. \"Skal and Enes the first guys out there and they ended up underneath me! I ain't going to the bottom, I'll tell you that right now.\" CJ McCollum: \"I took a strategic approach. They all tackled Dame and I just jumped toward the side of the pile so I didn't get trapped in the bottom. I jumped in late, like delayed, grabbed him but he was already getting tackled, he was trying to swim people off of him. So I just kind of jumped to the side, like, lemme jump in but I ain't trying to get caught up down here, I'm too small to be trapped. That was crucial.\" Moe Harkless: \"I ran over there, we all kind of jumped on the dogpile, but when dogpiles come around, I'm a little nervous. So I tried to get myself out of there because people at the bottom wasn't able to move. I remember, I think it was Evan or Chief (ed. note: it was Chief), one of them was all the way at the bottom and they just look so crazy in the picture. It was crazy, it was so fun. I had to get out of there, I'm cool on the dogpile. Somebody gonna get hurt, people sweaty? I'm good.\"  mood pic.twitter.com/OBpm4OKi1W \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) April 24, 2019  Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"I was kind of in the middle of the bench and when he hit that shot, I feel like when the ball was going in, I was moving toward the table, because any chance he comes to the bench, I probably be dead (laughs). I was like 'Just don't come here! Go anywhere else!' \"Funny story about that. Jon Yim, he's was probably one of the most excited. When he got excited, that's the end of the world. He's a super excited person, you just love to see. So I'm standing there and Jon Yim full sprint tried to jump on me. I was like 'Bro, what the heck you doing?' He's like 'No, no, no I'm not going to jump' and I'm like 'Bro you tried!' It was funny. To this day, me and Jon, I like 'Why you did that?' he like 'I know Nurk, I would not jump' like bro, just look at the clip! It was funny, I was just glad it wasn't something close. I guess it all turned out great.\" Zach Collins: \"I was not about to get up in there and get jumped on and landed on, so I was trying to keep my distance a little bit and still try to get in there. I was wondering if the fans would rush the court or something. I didn't know -- I'm sure there's pretty strict rules about it and they'll never let that happen -- but I was just kind of wondering what was going to happen. I really, for a second, I was like, so the clock is over and he just hit the shot, so we just won the entire series and now we're moving on. It kind of took me a second to get everything down. I was hyped for Dame because he hit the game-winner but then it was like, oh shit, we just won the series off that. It's incredible.\" Anfernee Simons: \"I was on the outside. I actually jumped in the air and everybody ran past me when I jumped. There\u2019s a little slo-mo video of him hitting the shot from an angle and then you see me jump into the frame, then out the frame, then come right back down. A jump is the most you\u2019re going to get out of me. I was on the outskirts.\"   After the initial pandemonium, Lillard does the postgame on-court interview with TNT, during which he's doused in water by his teammates. He then does a lap around the court to celebrate with fans before exiting to the locker room. Lillard finishes the game with 50 points on 17-of-33 shooting from the field, 10-of-18 shooting from three and 6-of-8 shooting from the line, seven rebounds, six assists, three steals and a block, all while sitting out for just two minutes and 44 seconds of regulation. Portland would go on to face the Denver Nuggets, the two-seed, in a series that they would eventually win in seven games to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in almost 20 years. And in the process, Lillard, and everyone who played their part in the fourth quarter of Game 5, delivered an indelible moment that will forever live in the lore of Rip City. Jusuf Nurki\u0107: \"It was just, I think, perfect. I couldn't do it better than the way everything happened. Even if I could plan it, I probably not going to do it the way I did.\" Zach Collins: \"Just the way it happened, it's kind of poetic because Dame has been here and he's been the guy who's willed this team to new heights and to the playoffs every single year. And then the back and forth with him and Russell and to do it in that fashion, in my personal opinion, he dominated all series and then just to put the cap on it with that shot, it was awesome. That series, I saw a side of Dame that I don't think I had seen before where he's talking on the court, he's excited, he's throwing up his wings for the bombs and everything. He was just so motivated to beat the other guy in the matchup that he wasn't going to let us lose that series. All of that kind of came to me at one time, and it was pretty awesome.\" CJ McCollum: \"Crazy situation to be a part of, for sure. I don't think I've ever been a part of anything like that.\" Moe Harkless: \"I just think us as a group, we really wanted to win that game. I think that run in general, but especially that game, I think it's kind of a summary of that team and how we were. Things started off good, then they got bad, then they went good, then it got bad again and then we found a way at the end.

McCollum discusses his thoughts about the postponement, what he's hearing as the team's NBAPA representative, trying to stay in shape, finishing out the 2019-20 season versus starting the 2020-21 season on time, the significant donations he recently made, keeping in tough with teammates, the prospect of playing games without fans, whether he's interested in participating in a H-O-R-S-E competition and getting a puppy. How are you and how is your puppy Fiona? CJ McCollum: She is good. She tries to run from me, but she's doing well. We just went on a walk, went on a nature walk, I didn't wipe her paws off so the couch is ruined. But she's doing well. We officially adopted her, so I can't take her back now... She peed on the carpet again today. Four weeks into the NBA season being postponed, where is your mind at in terms of how you see this moving forward? Do you have any thoughts about how you'd like to see the season proceed? CJ McCollum: I think we're heading in the right direction as a society. People are trying to social distance themselves, staying in the house, I think that's important, first and foremost. But in terms of the season starting back up, I have about as much information as you, maybe a little bit more. I think there's a lot to still be determined, obviously, based on what most of the government is saying, from no large gatherings of over 10 people. I think we have to kind of get around some of those hurdles and really just wait it out. I think the biggest thing, as I've said before, is safety, making sure everyone is safe. Obviously you want to play, I want to get back out there and play, in front of fans preferably, but I don't think we're in a position where we can execute that right now honestly. So we have to kind of wait and see how things go and I think Adam (Silver) has said before that he won't make any decisions and doesn't think he'll be able to make any decisions until, at a minimum, the beginning of May. Let's say the NBA resumed this summer. What do you think a timetable would be for getting cleared to go back to practice facilities and actually getting back to working out again? What would that look like to get back to playing games? CJ McCollum: I think the first thing we would have to do is get in shape, game shape. Obviously we're all trying to workout, we're trying to do what we can at home. Some people are going on runs, maybe riding bikes -- I have a stationary bike, Elise has a Peleton and I'm using the Keiser. But it's not the same as physically getting up and down and playing on a basketball court. So I think we'd have to take some time to kind of go through that process, that period of one-on-one, two-on-two, three-on-three, five-on-five getting up down full court. That would be very helpful. And then obviously, transition that to scrimmages and games. But I think it would take us some time, to say the least, especially depending on when we would end up starting. This is like Day 28, so that's 28 days for most guys that haven't shot a basketball, most guys haven't been on a court in general unless you have one or going outside, which is still not the same as playing an actual game or an actual practice. Have you been able to do anything in terms of shooting a basketball? With no home gym, how are you staying in basketball shape or is that even possible? CJ McCollum: I'm close. I told Todd (Forcier) the other day \"I'll stay close. I'm like a week away.\" I'll stay around a week away because I know if we were to come back we wouldn't be able to play a game for at least a few weeks, is my guess. I'm trying to stay as close as possible, but it's hard. It's hard to train in a way that's effective when you don't have all the resources. I'm not complaining about it, this is the situation that I'm in, I'm cool with it, but to actually be able to shoot would be great. I thought about buying a court, I'm actually thinking about going to Meyers' (Leonard) house. Meyers has a court and they said I could use their little basketball court, so I'll be able to get some shots up. But even if you go buy a court or whatever the case may be, it's not the same as the normal workouts you'd go through, the normal stuff that I would be doing to prepare for the season and for games. I haven't shot a basketball in at least two weeks... It's the other stuff -- your rhythm, your timing, all that stuff -- kind of shifts when you don't play for a while. You recently made significant donations to the Boys and Girls Club of the Portland-Metro area and the Akron-Canton Regional Food Bank. Why and why did you select those organizations? CJ McCollum: Well why is because I'm in a position where I can help. I think it's important that when you're in a position to do things within your means, you try to do them. Why them, I'm from Canton, Ohio. Canton has meant a lot to me. Being born there, having family still there, understanding the importance of food and understanding the importance of a time like this. I have family that have been laid off, I got family that are struggling right now trying to figure things out. I can only imagine how many people across the world are going through this same thing of either being laid off, not having checks, trying to figure out where the next meal is going to come from. The fact that there's 40 to 50 percent of kids on free or reduced lunch, so that's also a factor in my decision to really focus on the food aspect of it, especially in Canton, Ohio. And then obviously the ties here in Oregon are important to me, the Boys and Girls Club more specifically, has been a part of my life forever. A big, big portion of my giving and thought process is that kids are home now but they still can use virtual counseling. People that are working at the Boys and Girls Club are in a position where their salaries and way of life has been compromised, so just trying to help out any way that I can, but really putting the point of emphasis on kids and people who are struggling right now to kind of figure out what to do next. What do you think about pushing out the start of the 2020-21 season in order to finish out the 2019-20 season? Would you want to see this season get finished no matter what? Would you rather see next season start on time? CJ McCollum: Honestly, I haven't thought about it. People have been asking me about it and I just kind of go with the flow, I'm a go with the flow type of guy. But I think, in an ideal world, the sooner we could get started, the better for summer sake, for draft sake, for the sake of so many different sports that are going through the same thing. That would be ideal but that's probably not going to happen. I think I would be okay with a delayed start to next season if that meant we would be able to finish this season. Obviously people are throwing around Christmas, people are throwing around different dates, but I think it's all circumstantial. No one really knows right now, I think people are just kind of guessing. So for me, I just kind of go with the flow. If we could get back to playing, that would be great, and if next season is delayed a little bit, then so be it. You've probably seen that baseball is taking about bringing all the teams together to play in one location. That's been talked about for the NBA as well, do you think that's viable? Could bring all the teams to one location and keep everybody under quarantine? CJ McCollum: That's a great question. I'm sure if there is a way to do it, they'll figure it out, I'm not sure there is a way. But based on what I'm hearing, MLB is looking at certain locations, certain cities. They could probably target cities that don't have a stay at home ordinance, I think there's like seven to 10 places left in the United States to where I don't think they have a stay at home order because they don't have a lot of cases being spread right now. But unless you do it -- you'd have to do it in Las Vegas and like shut down The Strip. I don't know how you could really find an area that's completely isolated from outsiders, and that's the problem that I think MLB and most sports are facing. If you quarantine the players individually, you have to make sure they have interactions with no one, right? In a sense, you don't know family, where they'd be traveling from, you're basically isolating them because they could be an asymptomatic carrier, which could kind of disturb things and throw off the balance of everything you're trying to accomplish. I don't know how you do it, personally. I think we have people smart enough that they could try to figure out a way and if there is a way, one of these major sports organizations are going to figure it out. What are your thoughts on the prospect of playing games without fans? CJ McCollum: I've been talking to my friends about this. It would be weird. I'm not going to lie to you, it would be awkward, feel like a practice. But as a competitor, you just go compete. I joked with the team before this even happened when it was being proposed and I was like \"It'll be like some games I had a Lehigh over Christmas break when there's no one in the stands, everyone's home and it's just you, the media and the band.\" But in this case, it would be no one. It would be hard but as a competitor, you go do what you've got to do and once the fourth quarter comes, you're trying to win and I think you'd kind of be locked into the game so much that you'd forget. How are you keeping in touch with your teammates? CJ McCollum: I've been in contact with most of the guys, I'm actually missing a Zoom yoga session as we speak, so I'll have to get on next time. But we've been in contact. Obviously I talk to Dame pretty often, I still have to give him an update on things and what I've heard, have to give the rest of the guys updates. Every time I hear something or we have a discussion with the NBPA, I either put it in the group chat or we schedule a call and we kind of knock it out. I talk to Todd (Forcier) almost every day, he's sending workouts, making sure that we're doing what we're supposed to do. He's the one that's delivering the bikes to everyone and assembling the bikes and putting everything together. I've talked to Jess (Elis), I've talked to Neil (Olshey), I've talked to coaching staff, Terry and I talked last week. You just try to have those conversations. What you watching? What are you doing? How has it been going? Are you staying sane? Wha should I be watching? Kind of go from there. It's been fun, I'm going to try to utilize Zoom more so we can have some group conference calls and try to get grandma to figure that out as well. In your conversations with the NBA Players Association, how much of a worry is there about your own safety as player? CJ McCollum: I think that's one of the things that I've preached and we've preached is that safety first. We want to make sure that everyone is safe, first and foremost, not just in the NBA but around the world. If it's allowed by the government, if they give us the okay and they feel like it's safe for us to continue to play or resume play, then I think that's one thing. But I think we have all collectively agreed, and I think the NBA is on board as well -- Adam was the first one to kind of shut down a major sport in general. I think the other sports were considering still playing and we were kind of the frontrunners in that. I think everybody is on the same page, health comes first. Obviously a lot of money here is at stake but people's lives are more important than money and I think we've all come to that agreement that we want to make sure we're all being as safe as possible before we continue to move forward. Are you optimistic that the season will resume? Have you mentally moved on assuming that it's not going to happen? CJ McCollum: I haven't moved on yet. I'm still working out so I'm holding out hope that we're going to be able to come back at some point. Honestly, I have no idea, I think it's a coin flip. They're trying to figure it out, we're trying to figure it out, the government is trying to figure out what's going on. A lot of it is just education, figuring out the severity of everything, how it's continuing to evolve, when is the peak. Is the peak in two weeks? Is it not in two weeks? Is it going to come back in the fall? There's a lot that we just don't know. I'm continuing to put my head down and work as if we're returning here shortly. I think that's how you have to approach a situation like this. There's 24 hours in a day, plenty of time for me to still get some work in, work on other sectors and things I'm interested in. I'm holding out hope that we are going to return at some point, I don't know if that's true or not. I think that, as a player, you want to go out there and compete and you look forward to the chance to compete, especially since we're almost to the playoffs. There have been reports that there's going to be a H-O-R-S-E competition featuring NBA and WNBA players. Are you participating and what do you think about the idea? CJ McCollum: I haven't been in the loop on that one, I've only read about it. I don't have a basketball court though, and I'm not very good at H-O-R-S-E. If someone dunks or does something to well I'm automatically losing. If it's like a shooting contest -- I could arrange a setup where I could go get a court or something like that -- but I'm minimizing my pounding and the impact. "}

After all, Hood's season ended when he suffered a ruptured left Achilles tendon back in early December, so whether the 2019-20 season continues on in some fashion or not, it doesn't change much for the 6-8 swingman, other than that it deprives him, like so many others, of the joys of watching NBA basketball. \"For me, with the season being shut down, it doesn't really change too much for me,\" said Hood during a call with reporters Tuesday afternoon. \"I miss the game like crazy -- at home I'm always dribbling a basketball, I'm always watching basketball, I've very motivated to get back to being out there on the court and stuff like that. But it hasn't really changed much for me, just going through this pandemic. I think the biggest thing is safety, and when that time comes for me to step back out there, I'll be more than excited.\" But has the postponement of the NBA season, which has also resulted in access to team practice facilities, which house, amongst other things, team training and medical staff, being severely limited hindered Hood's ability to rehabilitate his ruptured Achilles? According to Hood, it hasn't been seamless, but it also hasn't significantly changed his ability to get treatment for his Achilles injury. \"I was going in before everything happened six days a week,\" said Hood. \"Now, I can use the facility three days a week -- the NBA has allowed that... It's just one-on-one contact, we can't be in group settings or nothing like that, so usually when me and him are working together it's just us two in the weight room or the training room. We're getting a lot of work in. It's been very good, I've been making a lot of progress even with everything going on.\" The NBA initially allowed teams to keep their practice facilities open after the season was postponed, albeit with increased social distancing efforts. Concerns over how even that level of activity might result the spread of COVID-19 resulted in access for healthy players being cut off. But after some cajoling from teams, the NBA agreed to let players like Hood who are rehabilitating serious injuries to receive treatment, though still in a limited fashion. \"I've been working out with Logan (Sullivan, team physical therapist) three days a week,\" said Hood. \"It's just one-on-one contact, we can't be in group settings or nothing like that, so usually when me and him are working together it's just us two in the weight room or the training room. We're getting a lot of work in. It's been very good, I've been making a lot of progress even with everything going on.\" However, even that progress will not result in Hood playing again this season, at least in the event that the NBA is able to continue the 2019-20 campaign. While it is likely that both Jusuf Nurki\u0107, who was set to make his return from a broken left leg just days before the season was postponed, and Zach Collins, whose had been out since November after undergoing surgery to repair a left shoulder dislocation, would be available if/when NBA basketball returns, Hood's Achilles injury, and the 12-month timetable for return that comes along with it, negates any prospect of him picking up where he left off back in November. \"I won't put myself in that position,\" said Hood. \"I need to give myself time to heal and to get back to myself. If it was just a regular injury, that's something different, but now I need to really make sure I get back right and not rush myself back. If I was fully healthy then that would be a possibility, but for right now, I just need to take my time.\" "}

Un triunfo m\u00e1s, que vino de la mano del center camerun\u00e9s, que tuvo la m\u00e1s m\u00e1gica noche en la NBA, rozando la cincuenta de puntos y siendo el aut\u00e9ntico l\u00edder de un equipo, que afrontaba el duelo ante los Hawks sin Ben Simmons y con la imperiosa necesidad de volver a recuperar las buenas sensaciones. Una victoria que parec\u00eda que llegar\u00eda de un modo sencillo, a tenor de lo vivido en el primer periodo. Y es que los Sixers acabaron los primeros doce minutos con una renta de 41-24, que parec\u00eda dejar el juego visto para sentencia. M\u00e1s aun cuando en el siguiente periodo el resultado se estabiliz\u00f3 y con parcial de 28-28, ambos equipos se marcharon a vestuarios con un margen favorable de los chicos de Brett Brown de 17 puntos de ventaja. Pero todo cambi\u00f3 en el tercer parcial. Al mismo tiempo Philadelphia se colapso y los Hawks resurgieron para no regalar tan f\u00e1cilmente el triunfo y robar a los Sixers una victoria en el Sur de Philadelphia. Tanto fue as\u00ed, que llegamos al \u00faltimo periodo con total incertidumbre y un resultado igualado, que perjudicaba claramente a los Sixers, ya que ven\u00edamos de tener una ventaja de 17 puntos al descanso, mientras que a falta de menos de diez minutos para el final del juego, el marcador reflejaba un inquietante 98-98. Pero justo ah\u00ed se terminaron las fuerzas para los Hawks y su intento de sorprender a los Sixers acab\u00f3 cuando el equipo de Philadelphia logr\u00f3 un parcial de 17-4 en apenas cinco minutos, para dejar casi sentenciado el encuentro. Fue muy agradable ver como los Sixers afrontaron la recta final del encuentro. En lugar de desesperarse por la ventaja perdida, lograron rehacerse y desde el 98-98, pasamos al definitivo 129-112, dejando anotar a los Hawks tan solo 14 puntos, por los 31 de los Sixers, en menos de diez minutos. Y como se ha mencionado, el aut\u00e9ntico h\u00e9roe de la noche fue Joel Embiid, que desde el primer momento estuvo muy acertado y concentrado el juego y enfocado en la victoria ante los Hawks. Sus n\u00fameros fueron para enmarcar, en su mejor partido en la NBA de su carrera, terminando con 49 puntos en su cuenta particular. Todo ello gracias a un excelente 17-24 en tiros de campo (1-3 en triples), a los que sum\u00f3 un sensacional 14-15 en tiros libres. Adem\u00e1s logr\u00f3 terminar el juego con un doble-doble, a rebotear en 14 ocasiones (4 de ellas en ataque), incluso repartiendo 3 asistencias, logrando 3 recuperaciones de bal\u00f3n y colocando un tap\u00f3n. A pesar de estos sensaciones n\u00fameros, no se vio solo en la cometida de vencer a Atlanta y otros jugadores de los Sixers tambi\u00e9n destacaron para arropar al center africano, siendo Tobias Harris quien mejor lo hizo. Con 25 puntos y un 9-18 en tiros libres (4-6 en triples), fue el mejor de los Sixers, despu\u00e9s de Embiid. Redonde\u00f3 su actuaci\u00f3n con 6 rebotes (todos defensivos), 4 asistencias, un robo de bal\u00f3n y un tap\u00f3n. Otro titular que super\u00f3 la decena de puntos anotados, fue Josh Richardson, que termin\u00f3 el juego con 13 puntos y un 4-12 en tiros de campo, sumando adem\u00e1s 6 rebotes y 3 asistencias. Tambi\u00e9n super\u00f3 la decena de puntos Furkan Korkmaz, que fue el mejor de la banca de los Sixers en el partido ante los Hawks. Acab\u00f3 el juego con 15 puntos, gracias a un 3-8 en tiros de campo, lanzado casi todo desde m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la l\u00ednea de tres puntos. Adem\u00e1s, acumul\u00f3 un 6-7 en tiros libres, 6 rebotes y 2 asistencias. Gran triunfo antes de preparar la visita a Cleveland, donde el equipo buscar\u00e1 un nuevo triunfo para poder terminar el mes de febrero con las buenas sensaciones que tanto le hacen falta en este tramo de la temporada.

You can watch the whole interview, though a few of the opening remarks have also been transcribed below... -----------------   ICYMI: Ernie Johnson was joined by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Monday night for the debut of #NBATogether with Ernie Johnson. Watch the new social talk show hosted by @TurnerSportsEJ Monday and Wednesday nights at 7:00 PM ET on @NBA! https://t.co/q2fHoa1CNR \u2014 NBA (@NBA) April 7, 2020  Do you have any kind of a better feel for where we are? Adam Silver: The short answer is no. And interestingly enough, I think if you and I on March 12 had been asked that same question, both of us would have said it's hard to imagine that three-plus weeks later, we wouldn't have a better understanding of where we are. And in fact, when we initially shut down -- we were calling it a hiatus or a pause -- there was a notion of 30 days because there wasn't any of the widespread view, at that point, that our country would in essence be entirely shut down over the next several weeks. And so the fact is now, sitting here today, I know less, in a way, than I did then. I think in some ways, just as I listen to the public health experts and the people that are advising us, the virus is potentially moving faster than maybe we had thought at that point, and therefore, may peak earlier. What that means, in terms of our ability to come back at some point in late spring or summer, is still unknown to me. Essentially what I've told my folks over the last week is we should just accept that, at least for the month of April, we won't be in a position to make any decisions. I don't think that necessarily means on May 1 we will be, but at least I know, I think just to settle everyone down a little bit, it doesn't mean that internally, both the league and in discussions with our players and the teams, that we aren't looking at many different scenarios for restarting the season, but I think it's honestly too early, given what's happened right now, to be able to project or predict where we'll be in a few weeks. Is there a date where you say \"If it goes to this, we can't finish the regular season, we will just go to playoffs.\" Are you trying to finish the regular season? Adam Silver: Honestly, we haven't made any decisions. In a perfect world, yes, we would try to finish the regular season in some form and then move on to the playoffs. But what I've learned, I think initially -- sort of first week, first two weeks -- we were looking at more specific scenarios in terms of if we start this date, what will that mean for the regular season? When would the playoffs begin? When would they conclude? Again, what I've learned over the last few weeks is we just have too little information to make those sort of projections. I will say though that, as I look out into the summer, there does come a point at which we would start impacting next season. Even there, I think a few weeks ago, nobody thought we were talking about a potential impact on next season independent of what we might choose to do to finish out regular season and playoffs. Again, I think now, because so little is known, we're here, we're ready to go. I don't want to leave the suggestion with anybody that we're not doing everything we possibly can to restart under the right circumstances, but of course, player safety and the health of everyone in the NBA family has to come first. That may mean that there's a scenario in which we can play without fans. That's something we look a lot at. In fact, I think the Warriors were scheduled to play the first fan-less game before we were shutdown, so we were looking at that possibility and thinking what that might mean, how would those games be televised, would we still play in huge NBA arenas or would we got to practice facilities, would we got to a single site. There's been a lot of conjecture about various cities and places that might hold a tournament. We're in listening mode right now, we've been contacted by many of those jurisdictions to ask what our level of interest is and we've talked to them about what their capabilities are. But once again, there's too much unknown right now. "}

There's little clarity right now regarding which of those two options is the most likely, which is understandable considering it has proven difficult to predict how the coronavirus pandemic is going to play out over the coming weeks and months, but at some point, one of those two things is going to happen. After it's decided how the 2019-20 season will end, the NBA will move on to handing out hardware for post-season awards. A disappointing season will almost surely result in members of the Trail Blazers missing out on most of those accolades, though Damian Lillard, who has averaged 28.9 points on 46 percent shooting from the field and 39 percent shooting from three, 7.8 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 36.9 minutes per game this season, will at least be in the running for All-NBA honors. But while he's not going to win Most Valuable Player -- that honor will go to either Giannis Antetokounmpo or LeBron James -- ESPN's Zach Lowe, on a recent edition of \"The Lowe Post\" podcast, put him fourth on his current ballot despite Portland's record. However, Bill Simmons, Lowe's guest on this episode, did not... Zach Lowe: You mentioned that you really prioritized team record, that's why you're going to hate this choice. Can you guess who I'm talking about yet? Bill Simmons: No. Zach Lowe: Damian Lillard. Damian Lillard fourth. Bill Simmons: Speechless! Zach Lowe: Silence. Bill Simmons: I didn't even have him in my (top) eight! Zach Lowe: Wow. I think Dame had a slept-on, sensational season that is statistically just a couple of rebounds a game different than Doncic's in terms of all-around numbers: 29 and 8 on 40 percent shooting from three on 10 threes a game. He had one of the greatest stretches that we've ever seen in like the modern history of the NBA when he went berserk for a couple of weeks. Again, 28 and 8, 40 percent shooting, the Blazers with all of their injuries right -- their whole front line is injured -- are absolute roadkill without him. He's one of the great culture-setters in the NBA and at some point, I have to reward him. He played 500 more minutes than Kawhi and 300-plus more minutes than Luka and just the sheer amount of on-court availability, I think, and his obvious value to the Blazers, I wanted to reward him for his minutes and his availability. Statistically, he's neck-and-neck -- if you look at all the advance numbers -- he's neck-and-neck with Luka and Kawhi and Jokic, like they're all around in the same boat. And so I just said, \"Look at the minutes, the guy is on the court for 400, 300, 500 more minutes, this is X amount of games, I'm gonna reward him and pencil him in or cement him in.\" Damian Lillard is fourth on my MVP ballot despite the fact that the Blazers, yes, are 29-37. They were 2-6 when he was injured, so they were 27-31 with him. They have a positive scoring margin when he's on the floor. Considering their injuries, I do believe that it's possible to be a top five MVP player -- not top three maybe, but four and five -- on a team that's mediocre. So I put Damian Lillard -- and you're going to lambast me -- on my own podcast and I'm fine with that. I feel comfortable with my choice. Simmons then states that All-NBA, rather than Most Valuable Player, as a better way to reward great players on so-so teams, which seems like an incredibly reasonable take. After all, most every player would prefer making an All-NBA team over simply finishing in the running for MVP. One is an actual award, the other is a piece of trivia. You can listen to the entire episode here if you want to know who else Lowe and Simmons have on their respective ballots. "}

He's got a home gym, so he's able to workout every day with no fear of exposure to the coronavirus. He runs in the morning, lifts weights and gets in a lot of core work in between taking walks with his fianc\u00e9 and son, watching shows and movies on various streaming services and working on new tracks for an upcoming mixtape. But with no practice nor games, Lillard, like many who either play or work in and/or around the NBA, feels a bit adrift as the shelter in place and social distancing policies continue for the immediate future. \"I feel like I wake up every day and I'm just kind of like, 'What should I be doing?'\" said Lillard Tuesday afternoon. \"I wake up like 'What should I be doing? What's the next thing? Should we be prepared to play?' So I'm just trying to like, stay on edge and ready to come back whenever they call us back.\" Though he has no better idea of when that might be than the general public. In large part, that's due to the fact that it's difficult to ascertain when the pandemic will have run its course, making it all but impossible for the NBA to come up with anything more than contingencies for when it's safe enough to resume the season. And another reason is simply because Lillard isn't hounding his agent or the league office on a regular basis asking for updates. He figures when the time comes, someone at the NBA will reach out. \"I haven't heard anything,\" said Lillard. \"I've honestly been sitting around, trying to stay active, doing stuff to try and stay in shape and sitting in the house and just waiting. I haven't been seeking out extra information and trying to figure out all that stuff. Like I said, it's more concerning to me the people who are out of work and trying to keep they heads above water. I think about that stuff. And the NBA stuff, when they let us know, they let us know. It's gonna be what it's gonna be.\" But while Lillard doesn't have any sense of when basketball might resume, he does have some thoughts on how the NBA should go about finishing out the season. \"It's obviously going to be a different situation than it's ever been, so maybe they should do something that has never been done or something that's going to make this year very unique, like it already has been,\" said Lillard. \"So I think they should do something like the NCAA Tournament with every team, single-game elimination all the way up until maybe the conference finals or something like that, then it's a three-game series so we don't got to start the season off track next year. They could get creative. If there was any time for them to get super creative and people will be tuned in and excited about it with everything that's going on, I think this is the time.\" However, there's one drastic change that Lillard is unequivocally against: pushing out the start of the 2020-21 season in order to facilitate finishing out the 2019-20 season. Moving opening day of the NBA season from late October to late December in order to lessen the competition with the NFL for eyeballs has long been a topic of discussion in the league office, and some have floated the idea that having to push out the end of the 2019-20 season due to COVID-19 is an opportunity to test out that sea-change. But Lillard is adamantly against permanent, wholesale changes to the schedule, especially those which would move the offseason from summer to fall. There's any number of reasons why such a change would be problematic -- the NBA season not generally matching up with the NCAA season would pose draft issues, it's very likely NBA players would no longer be able to compete in the Olympics or FIBA competitions and starting a season when most are preoccupied by the holidays being just three issues -- but for Lillard, the start of the NBA season coinciding with the team people start spending more time indoors is a combination that shouldn't be trifled with. \"I'm not a big fan of them pushing the start of (next) season back because then that pushes everything back. I really ain't a fan of that happening,\" said Lillard. \"Our break is during the summer and then you come back as the summer is leaving, I think that's been perfect. I think it's been perfect for us, so for that to change and things to be pushed back, I'm definitely not a fan of that and I just don't see many guys being a fan of that.\" Of course, it's possible that the 2019-20 season is simply lost to the pandemic. With shelter in place and social distancing lasting until May at the very earliest, it's very possible we get to a point where trying to restart play simply isn't feasible. Lillard, along with the rest of the NBA community, hopes that won't be the case, but he's confident that whatever decision is made, it will be made with the right priorities in mind. \"I'm definitely a little worried that (canceling the 2019-20 season) is a possibility but I'm encouraged because I know that the league is doing everything in their power to make sure that it does (come back),\" said Lillard. \"I know that if we don't come back that it will be for the right reasons, it'll be for the sake of all of our health and that's what's first. But I think that at some point we will be back and if not, I think it'll be a great reason for that.\" "}

After earning his first NBA All-Star selection this year, Booker is being honored with another achievement beyond the hardwood, being announced as a Special Olympics Global Ambassador. From the \u201cDevin Booker Starting Five,\u201d an unprecedented initiative\u00a0to donate $500,000 a year over the next five years ($2.5 million total) to Phoenix Suns Charities in support of\u00a0Arizona children and families in need,\u00a0to his continual outreach in the city of Phoenix and throughout The Valley, these philanthropic efforts reflect how Booker lives his life. He tipped-off the Starting Five campaign in November as he personally surprised five local non-profits each with $100,000, including, naturally, the Special Olympics Arizona, who will use the funds to build their own facility for the first time ever. The facility will be completed with a Suns branded multipurpose room engaging coaches and athletes with everything from art to shooting hoops. The NBA recognized Booker\u2019s game-changing impact, as the 23-year-old received the November NBA Cares Community Assist Award. \u201cI hope the way I perform on the court can inspire people, but the things I do off the court is what I want people to take away from me,\u201d Booker said.  The local community and beyond has also taken notice. \u201cEverywhere I go in Phoenix, I see Booker uniforms,\u201d Head Coach Monty Williams said. \u201cThat says a lot about what this community and what children in general feel about Devin and his impact here. You feel it when you\u2019re around town, when I\u2019m at my kids\u2019 school. Young kids around this town say \u2018Book.\u2019 They don\u2019t say \u2018Devin Booker\u2019 they say \u2018Book.\u2019 That means a lot to this organization, but it certainly means a lot to these kids who look up to him.\u201d Booker\u2019s benevolence can be attributed to his family and, more specifically, his younger sister Mya. Mya was born 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 22. The deletion causes poor development of several body systems, which can result in mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Witnessing Mya overcome these challenges, all while exuding more positivity than anyone else in the room, inspires Booker each and every day. \u201cGrowing up with a sister that has to face new challenges every day has given me a new perspective for life,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI always wanted her to be the best at everything she did. She wanted to be a singer, artist, everything she did, I feel as an older brother, was to support to the best of my ability.\u201d The two share an unbreakable bond because to Booker, she is more than just a sister, she\u2019s his best friend. \u201cThat\u2019s my heart,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThat\u2019s my love. That\u2019s my best friend. I think just the way she approaches life every day. She deals with her challenges. She comes in with a smile every day, every situation that she\u2019s in. She just finds the positive in it and that has just helped me throughout my whole career, my whole life.\u201d Due to his sister\u2019s condition and his ever-continuing push for equality in the world, the Special Olympics has always been something near and dear to Booker\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen it comes to Special Olympics I feel right at home,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m taking care of one of my little brothers or little sisters.\u201d  Just as he supports his sister, Booker shares that same support for others dealing with intellectual disabilities through his involvement with Special Olympics. Since being drafted to the Phoenix Suns in 2015, Booker has been closely connected with Special Olympics Arizona through clinics across the Valley and developing friendship with local athletes. \u201cI\u2019ve celebrated the accomplishments and witnessed the challenges my sister Mya has experienced as a person with intellectual disabilities,\u201d Booker said. \u201cShe motivates me every day, and I\u2019m humbled to be part of Special Olympics, a global organization with a mission to help spread awareness about the abilities of people with ID.\u201d Booker continues to grow these connections every day as he strives to grow closer with his community and while supporting those with ID.  In 2016, Booker invited his number one fan Jenna Warren, who has down syndrome, to join him on a trip to New York City for the Draft Lottery. He then followed that up the next year by surprising Special Olympic Arizona athlete Noah Smith with that same opportunity in 2017. In November of 2019, Booker announced Special Olympics Arizona as one of the organizations awarded $100,000 as part of the \u201cDevin Booker Starting Five\u201d initiative. And now Booker and Special Olympics are taking it a step further, as Special Olympics International announced Devin Booker as their newest Special Olympics Global Ambassador on Thursday.  As a Special Olympics Global Ambassador, Booker will promote inclusion through sport, especially opportunities involving basketball while utilizing his reach with younger audiences through social media. He will continue to be involved with local and global opportunities as he has in the past, through activations with Special Olympics International, Special Olympics China, Special Olympics North America and Special Olympics Arizona. \u201cSpecial Olympics is honored to name Devin Booker as our newest Global Ambassador,\u201d said Special Olympics International CEO, Mary Davis. \u201cPeople like Devin who have a sibling with intellectual disabilities possess inherent empathy for the population we serve. We are lucky to leverage his passion to inspire others around the world to join our all-out effort to end discrimination against and empower people with intellectual disabilities.\u201d  Booker joins a star-studded list of Special Olympics Global Ambassadors, including his teammate Ricky Rubio as well as Andre Drummond, Damian Lillard, Elena Delle Donne, Dikembe Mutombo, Sam Perkins and Yao Ming. \u201cI\u2019m proud that Devin was an All-Star this year, but being named Global Ambassador makes me feel super proud to be his teammate,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis shows how much he impacts people\u2019s lives beyond a basketball court. Congratulations and let\u2019s make a big impact in this world. I\u2019m with you!\u201d Tune-in today at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to #NBATogetherLive on NBA\u2019s Instagram as Booker will join ESPN\u2019s Maria Taylor to talk about his new Global Ambassador role with Special Olympics, his relationship with his sister and how he\u2019s staying busy during the NBA hiatus.

So after working through the details, the team announced last week that Allen, the players and the team were committing more that $1.4 million toward relief efforts, with part of those donations going to pay employees for nine postponed Trail Blazers games. Now, the team is turning their attention to the community. The organization announced on Monday the creation of a COVID-19 relief fund with the goal of supporting local non-profits impacted by the pandemic. Some of the donations will also be used to support the Oregon Community Foundation\u2019s COVID-10 Pooled Fund, which is doling out resources for community-based organizations that are already confronting the outbreak and its economic repercussions. The efforts of the Trail Blazers are a part of the NBA\u2019s \u201cNBA Together\u201d campaign, which seeks to raise awareness about prevention of COVID-19 while also raising money for those effected by the pandemic. More than $35 million of a $50 million goal has already been donated by NBA and WNBA teams and players. But while raising money to combat the spread of COVID-19 and support those effected by closures and cancellations is incredibly important, funds alone are not enough to help those coping with both the virus and the issues associated with social distancing and quarantines. So to help put the community in touch with various services ranging from free food for kids while schools are closed to online adult education courses, the team has created a virtual resources center which has links to over 100 nonprofits, businesses and governmental organizations providing both services and assistance accessing services during the outbreak. For those struggling to make ends meet, there\u2019s information about financial assistance from places likes the City of Portland\u2019s Water Bureau, Human Solutions and St. Vincent de Paul. Trying to figure out how to entertain the kids while working from home? There are links to online videos and workouts from Beaverton Hoop YMCA, free educational resources from EVERFI and Education.com and access to free laptops and computers for K-12 students from Free Geek. Local restaurants such as Canard, Laughing Planet, Grain &amp; Gristles and G\u00fcero are just a few of the places offering free food to students during school closures. And for those struggling with being cooped up indoors, CorePower Yoga, Bare3 and BurnMVMT are offering free online classes, Headspace is making their meditations available at no cost and Simple Habit is offering Self Care Plans. Members of the community are encouraged to submit services and resources to be included on the Resource Center. Those who are able can also go to trailblazers.com/donate to support the Trail Blazers Foundation COVID-19 Relief Fund. "}

Take it away, Lillard clan...   #somethingnewchallenge A post shared by  Damian Lillard (@damianlillard) on Mar 23, 2020 at 9:24pm PDT  NBA players spend roughly two months on the road during the NBA regular season (my unofficial \"time spent on the road\" math: 41 games x 1.5 days per game = 61.5 days, though with the decrease of back-to-backs over the last few seasons, it's probably closer to 2.0 days per game) broken up over the course of of six months, which can make it difficult to do the sort of activities that require being close to home for an extended period of time. One such activity is raising a puppy, which anyone who has used vacation days in order to stay home with a new canine addition can tell you.

And here's CJ on CBS Sports discussing what he's doing to stay in as good of shape as possible for the eventual return of games...  \u201cPlaying board games, cooking a little bit. I\u2019ve been able to use my time and energy towards other areas.\u201d - @CJMcCollum on what his days have been like lately pic.twitter.com/lhNVdWTlST \u2014 CBS Sports HQ (@CBSSportsHQ) March 26, 2020  \u2022 Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurki\u0107 was only a few days away from making his triumphant return to the court when the NBA season was suspended, robbing the 7-0 center of his homecoming after a year of rehabbing a broken left leg. With plenty of time to reflect, Nurki\u0107 penned a post on Instagram on the inauspicious anniversary of his injury...   I\u2019m so emotional but can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been a year since my injury. It doesn\u2019t matter how deep you fall what really matters is how high you bounce back. In my life I learn to overcome difficulties but everyone has a fate and own destiny. Faith is trusting God even when you don\u2019t understand His plan. Ones again I want to thank everyone. A year ago you guys did something special for me it meant the world to me  after all I\u2019m 100% healthy and can\u2019t wait to play basketball  again  Until then, stay safe and healthy  Love Nurk  #nurkback #thereturn #nurkfever #staysafe #staystrong #stayhome A post shared by  Jusuf Nurki\u0107 (@bosnianbeast27) on Mar 25, 2020 at 12:25pm PDT  In his latest \"Melo Monday\" video, Trail Blazers forward Carmelo Anthony gives his thoughts on the NBA's decision to suspend the season before taking a tour of winery Domaine Serene in Dayton...   With schools closed until the end of April and many employers mandating employees work from home, parents all over Oregon and Washington are spending more time with their children, whether they want to or not. While that's not exactly the situation for Trail Blazers center Hassan Whiteside, he too is using the extra time at home to keep his skills sharp while also imparting some important lessons to his young son...   Quarantine or not it\u2019s still No easy buckets chill out son he tried to go up with the one hand after lol A post shared by  Hassan Whiteside (@hassanwhiteside) on Mar 23, 2020 at 12:16pm PDT  "}

A tireless worker, the 6-4 guard out of Lehigh is often one of the last players to leave the court after practices, has a regiment of non-court workouts, including yoga and meditation, and participates in offseason runs with various NBA players during the summer months. But with the coronavirus pandemic impacting nearly every aspect of daily life, McCollum has found other ways to while away the hours while following recommendations from public health officials to remain indoors and as isolated as possible. Here's what CJ had to say about the first days after the NBA announced that the 2019-20 NBA season would be postponed until at least mid-June, his thoughts on how the NBA season might proceed, his attempts at social distancing and being a \"full-time doggy dad...\" What was it like for you in the initial days after the NBA announced the season would be postponed? CJ McCollum: \"It was weird, I kind of knew it was going to be a while, so I didn\u2019t go into the practice facility right away. I think we had a team meeting the next day, so I went in for that, grabbed some things I figured I might need. Had Melo sign some stuff and he\u2019s like \u2018This isn\u2019t goodbye!\u2019 and I was like \u2018Just in case, lemme get some stuff signed now. Don\u2019t forget to pull me a jersey,\u2019 kind of going through that process of how I would normally do things once the season ends. But then understanding that the season is going to resume at some point, we just don\u2019t know when. \"Went home, relaxed, basically took like a week off, just recollecting myself, enjoying time with my fianc\u00e9, staying in the house, staying out the way, going on walks, that type of stuff and then I began to get back int the mindset of working out again. I get to workout, I lift and then close the facility down, so I was like \u2018Alright, I guess I should have built that gym when I figure bought this house.\u2019 You never know what\u2019s going to happen, so now I\u2019m ordering stuff I can use in the house, thinking about building something where I can actually lift and have everything I need here. The process and problem with that is, for one, you don\u2019t know who\u2019s working right now. For two, you don\u2019t want to put anybody in position to comprise their health. And three, by the time it\u2019s done it\u2019ll be time to start (the NBA) again and I won\u2019t even need it. It\u2019s different, but I\u2019m just thankful that my loved ones are in a place where they\u2019re safe, they\u2019re in the house, they\u2019re following the protocol, social distancing and all that stuff. It gives me perspective to kind of relax, sit back and kind of take it all in and be still for a minute.\" With the life of an NBA player typically being so regimented and scheduled, have you found yourself forgetting even for a moment that there are no games to play or watch or is this regular life now? CJ McCollum:\u00a0\"I\u2019ve shifted, my mentality has shifted. It\u2019s shifted to the offseason mentality in terms of no alarm, wake up when you feel like it, get done what you need to get done. Understand that you\u2019re probably going to have to come back to play at some point, but also understanding that you need that rest, mentally and physically, you only get away from the game. The pounding is gone, you can still workout and do some sorts of things that you would normally do but you\u2019re not physically going to get that five-on-five practice and game play that you would normally get almost every day.\" Do you have any thoughts on how you think the league should proceed or how they might proceed once the outbreak is contained? CJ McCollum:\u00a0\"I think as long as they\u2019re doing what\u2019s right from a health standpoint for all parties involved \u2014 fans, players, ownership, coaching staff \u2014 I think as long as they follow the rules, guidelines and regulations that are issued by the government, I think we\u2019re in a good place and I think the NBA has been at the front of the line in terms of making decisions that are health-based and not based on finances.\u00a0 I think as long as we continue to follow those guidelines, we\u2019ll be in a great spot to return at some point. Whenever that is, I know they won\u2019t rush it, I know they\u2019ll make sure everything is in place the way it should be. When that time comes, we\u2019ll be ready to go, but until then, I think it\u2019s best we\u2019re as safe as possible: staying in the house, making sure that we\u2019re reducing everyone\u2019s chances of obtaining the virus and spreading it.\" How are you handling staying indoors and the changes in routine? Seems like a lot of people are going a bit stir-crazy. CJ McCollum:\u00a0\"I\u2019m good. I\u2019m staying in the house, just got some kettlebells in, ordering some more products to workout in the house and some more products for my new puppy. \"I think people should definitely take this seriously. Obviously you have the age gaps to where you\u2019ve got kids of spring break wildin\u2019 out, you got a lot of different stuff you\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s just part of that generation and culture of not taking things seriously. But then you have the people who are following protocol, are staying in the house, especially the people who are more mature. I\u2019ve left the house four times in the last 15 days now. Once was to get my puppy, one was to get some gas and then I went on two walks. I\u2019ve basically been in the house for almost two and a half weeks. \"It\u2019s been hard to not workout and do some of the things I normally do but it\u2019s also been a nice challenge of just enjoying nature, enjoying sitting around with people you care about, having real conversations. People are probably putting together puzzles, playing board games, doing things they wouldn\u2019t normally do in the house. It\u2019s just more human interaction, I think that\u2019s good for the body and soul sometimes because we live on our phones, we watch sports, we watch different TV shows, we go through that cycle of constant movement to where now, we\u2019re complaining about the things we\u2019ve wanted and yearned for. We always wanted a break, we always wanted to sit down and be home for more than two days. Now you\u2019re forced to be home and no one wants to stay in the house.\" There are certainly worse ways to spend the time that fostering a puppy. What\u2019s her name? How is it going so far? CJ McCollum:\u00a0\"We\u2019re still working on that. We\u2019re foster parents right now but we\u2019re probably going to be adopting knowing us. We\u2019ve had her for five hours, she hasn\u2019t barked once. Trying to get her to go pee, but it\u2019s a process. I don\u2019t know what type of owner she had before us, she\u2019s a little shy, she\u2019s definitely scared and timid, but we finally hand fed her and trying to get her to drink some water. We\u2019ll get there, we\u2019ll come around. I had Rottweilers growing up so this is just taking me down memory lane again. \"It\u2019s definitely something my fianc\u00e9 and I have talked about, we both grew up with dogs \u2014 she grew up with Yorkies, I grew up with Rottweilers so we had to find a compromise. I told her that we\u2019re not ready for a dog full-time, she went behind my back essentially and fostered a dog without telling me until I got home and then told me what kind of dog she asked for because she knew that I would be like \u2018Oh, okay.\u2019 And here we are. I\u2019m excited about it, I\u2019ve had dogs before, obviously in different situations and circumstances as a kid where I walked it, I cleaned up after it but my parents were like the sole ownership group. The only time I had a dog by myself, I was 14. My brother and I wanted to get a Rottweiler but our mom said it was our responsibility full-time, so we took care of it, we trained it and all that stuff. And then the season started and it was just too much, we had to make a decision. \"I\u2019m happy that I can actually take care of it, I can be around it, I can really put time in. I\u2019m sure people out there that are fathers and mothers right now are really enjoying being around their kids, although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s painful at times. This is probably the only time in our lives to where everyone will be in the house essentially 24 hours a day for weeks at a time. This will probably never happen again in our lives, honestly, because of work and travel and families and people just being socially connected. This is our time to really engage and be around each other. I\u2019m a full-time doggy dad right now. I\u2019m watching my dog sleep right now, that\u2019s how engaged I am.\" "}

In addition to contributions from the Trail Blazers Foundation, the COVID-19 Relief Fund has already raised money from Trail Blazers players and is part of the NBA Family\u2019s goal of raising over $50M to support people and organizations impacted by COVID-19. To date, more than $35M has been raised by NBA and WNBA teams and players. In addition, the organization created a virtual Resource Center to connect community members to helpful resources in the greater Portland Area as well as some support available across Oregon and even virtually. Individuals can visit rosequarter.com/help to search for everything from basic needs to food to activities for kids and health and wellness. The site will be reviewed and updated each weekday. Fans are invited to submit any resources for review and posting. \u201cWe are proud of our community for stepping up to support one another in this time of crisis,\u201d said Chris McGowan, President &amp; CEO of the Trail Blazers and Rose Quarter. \u201cWe are committed to using our platform to both raise funds and connect people to the resources they need during these challenging times.\u201d Since 2014, the Trail Blazers, Levy Restaurants, and Urban Gleaners have been teaming up to recover surplus food from Moda Center to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger in our region. With the closing of local schools and businesses, this is needed now more than ever. The Trail Blazers and Levy have donated over 5,000 pounds of food to Urban Gleaners in partnership with Sysco Food Services of Portland since closing our doors to the public on March 12. Over 48,000 pounds of food has been donated since starting the program in 2014, providing food for thousands of children and families and diverting thousands of pounds of food waste.

{"team": "blazers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/blazers/what-if-damian-lillard-only-shot-35-feet", "date": "2020-03-19 00:00:00", "tags": ["Lillard, Damian", "Trail Blazers"], "article": " The hiatus of the NBA season due to the COVID-19 pandemic has put sports on hold, and in the case of the Portland Trail Blazers, has put a halt to Damian Lillard\u2019s phenomenal season. Lillard is averaging a career high 28.9 points per game in 2019-20, a career high 7.8 assists per game, and is shooting a career high 39.4% from three point range on the year. He currently ranks 5th in total points with 1,677, despite missing 8 games this season. Even more incredible, he\u2019s shooting 6-9 from 35-39 feet away from the basket. For someone known for his shooting prowess, lately Dame has seemed to thrive even more than usual the further away from the basket he is. So while we await a return to normalcy, let\u2019s have a little fun with hypotheticals and pose this question: What if \u2013 rather than play basketball the intended way \u2013 Damian Lillard exclusively shot from between 35-39 feet for every single shot. No acrobatic layups, no powerful dunks, not even any regular old 33-foot stepback treys. What if Dame just pulled up from the logo all the time? In today's least surprising news, Dame drained a half court shot. pic.twitter.com/iMqUQ68hc4 \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) January 24, 2020  I\u2019ve conducted this incredibly unscientific experiment by doing the following: I\u2019ve taken every box score from the 2019-20 season and focused on Damian Lillard\u2019s total field goals attempted. Then, I\u2019ll figure out how many of those shots he\u2019d make based on his 35+ foot shooting percentage. He\u2019s currently shooting 66.67% from that distance this season, but let\u2019s be conservative and say over the course of the season that\u2019ll even out to be about 60%. Then, I\u2019ll multiply the number of shots made by three to get his new point total. We\u2019re also going to assume that, because Dame won\u2019t be driving into the lane as much, he will likely shoot fewer free throws than typical, so I\u2019m going to cut the number of free throws made in each game by half. In the case of an uneven amount of points, I\u2019ll give Logo Lillard the benefit of the doubt and round all point totals up assuming he lands above .5. Maybe that all sounds a little confusing, so let\u2019s do a little practice. Game 1 vs. the Denver Nuggets on October 23, 2019. Despite a valiant 32-point effort from Dame, the Blazers fell 100-108. But in this new scenario, Dame shoots 21 times from 35-39 feet, resulting in 38 points (rounded up from 37.8). Add half of his 9 made free throws (4.5) and he finishes with 42, a +10 point difference that gives the Blazers enough to secure a 2 point win on opening night. Does this make absolutely no logical sense? Yes. Is it fun to think about? 100%. So let\u2019s reimagine the rest of the season with this new formula. A previous three point loss to the Spurs on October 28 where Dame missed a buzzer beater from the corner turns into a 23 point win thanks to 54 points from Lillard, in a game in which he shoots 17 of 28 from way beyond the arc. Two losses on a back-to-back against the Clippers and Nets in early November turn into two wins as Dame drops 42 in the first game (20 points better than his real life performance) and a career high 66 in a win against the Nets (in reality, Dame dropped 61 in a 4 point loss). Through the end of the calendar year, the only games in which Dame\u2019s point total doesn\u2019t increase are November 2 against the Sixers, where his new shooting strategy backfires and he only scores 29 (as opposed to the 33 he scored in real life, Portland loses either way). And on November 12, he only shoots 10 times for a paltry 24 points, compared to the 27 he scored in real life. Again, the Blazers would have lost the game either way. In no instance of Dame\u2019s new shooting strategy do the Blazers lose a hypothetical game they won in the real world. A 12 point loss to the Thunder on December 8 becomes a 7-point win when Dame scores 47. He drops 41 in back to back games against the Pelicans and Jazz during Christmas week, flipping the result of both games. The Blazers were 14-20 at the New Year this season, with Dame only shooting logo threes, they\u2019re 25-8, pending the result of a November 4 game against Golden State that the Blazers originally lost by 9 (by shooting only 35+ foot threes, Dame scores 9 points more than he did in reality, so hypothetically this game goes to overtime.) In late January, things get bonkers. Dame scores 47 against the Mavericks and flips the result of the game into a 5 point win for Portland. He follows that up with 46 points against the Thunder in a game the Blazers lose by 1. Two nights later, he puts up 37 shots against the Warriors. Dame scored 61 points in this game in real life, but by shooting 60% from deep, he puts up 75 points in the game, scoring the third most points in a game in NBA history. He doesn\u2019t score less than 48 points for the rest of the month, averaging 43.4 points per game in January. Heading into the All-Star break, he continues to put up gaudy numbers, flipping the results of two games. A 7-point loss in Memphis (the game in which Dame suffered a groin injury) turns into a 9 point win when Lillard scores 36. After returning from injury he flips one more game, the March 7 loss to the Kings, before we arrive at our current state. Through these 58 games, Lillard scores 2,275 points, which leads the NBA ahead of James Harden\u2019s 2,096. He is averaging 39.2 points per game, which would rank as the third most in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 1961-62 (50.3 PPG) and 1962-63 (44.8) seasons. Portland would be 46-19, good for the #2 seed in the West. To reiterate, this thought experiment has no basis in reality. Lillard would in all likelihood not continue to average 60% shooting from near half court, and teams would surely begin double-teaming him as soon as he crossed the line. But the point still stands: what if Logo Lillard was forever?  "}

The two discuss their initially thoughts on the cancellation, with both emphasizing the importance of professional athletes planning ahead for an uncertain future (which also applies to just about everyone). But while the issues with COVID-19 are certainly at the forefront of everyone's mind, McCollum, being the good interviewer that he is, gets the show back on track by refocusing on Anthony's mindset when the was out of work, his return to the NBA and his arrival in Portland. Some of the more interesting quotes... Carmelo on signing with Portland... \"I think the biggest part of it was I had to be right mentally, I had to be right emotionally and spiritually.\u00a0 What I always tell people now is Portland came at a pivotal time in my life and my career. I needed Portland at this point in time, what I was looking for as far as on the court and off the court. I needed it, I needed the serenity of being in Portland, I need the space, I needed this me time to figure out me at the end of the day and to get my mind right and to focus on my body and emotionally. I really needed Portland. As much as they needed me from a basketball standpoint, I needed Portland for other reasons. I always say \u2018God don\u2019t make no mistakes\u2019 and this came at a pivotal time for me and I\u2019m taking advantage of it. And as you can see, it shows, right? I\u2019m not talking from a basketball standpoint, it\u2019s just the happiness and just being here and just being around the guys and being able to love the game again and travel and talk and give my experience and give my knowledge to people. That\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me at this point.\" On his thoughts when it seemed as though he might not get another shot in the NBA... \"When the unfortunateness happened, it was like, I started questioning myself why. Why? What happened? What did I do? Did I do something wrong? Was it me? Am I good? Can I still play? It was like all of these thoughts started to come in and that stuck with me for about four, five months. It wasn\u2019t until I started incorporating myself into my son\u2019s basketball and his life. I started going on trips with my AAU program and I started to be around the kids and one part of me was like, really embarrassed. I was embarrassed being around the kids. You know kids is very honest, so I didn\u2019t want to deal with those questions. \u2018Yo, what happened Melo? What happened?\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to deal with that. \u2018Man, what happened?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to deal with that, so I was embarrassed to like, go to the tournaments. And then my wife was like, \u2018Yo, what are you doing? You\u2019re going to this tournament.\u2019 My son is like \u2018Dad, you\u2019re not going?\u2019 and I usually tried to make excuses like \u2018Nah, you know what, I might be signing with a team next week.\u2019 So I had to deal with all of that but I was just masking emotions and frustrations and then I was like \u2018I\u2019m gonna go.\u2019 I had a real conversation with my wife and she was just like \u2018You know what, at the end of the day, if it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. But you can\u2019t control that. You\u2019ve been in the league 16 years, who can say that they lasted 16 year in the NBA at your level?\u2019 And I\u2019m just like, you know, that makes a lot of sense but I still wasn\u2019t trying to hear it.\" Carmelo on how he judges teammates... \"When you ask somebody \u2018Who is your favorite teammate?\u2019 they gonna go off the relationship that they have with that person. How do we get along? Are we familiar with each other? Do we hang out with each other? I judge you off of how do you prepare? How do you come to work every single day? How do you get along with everybody? How do you get along with the rookie? How do you get along with the 15-year vet? How do you treat the audio/visual guy? That\u2019s how I judge my teammates. When we go into the trenches, where you at? What is your preparation? What is your mindset? What are you thinking about? Are you willing to put your mind and your body on the line and do what it takes to win this one basketball game? Let\u2019s lock in. That\u2019s how I judge teammates.\" "}

After losing to the Suns Friday night in Phoenix in a game that wasn't as close as the final score indicated, the Trail Blazers were blown out 123-111 by the Sacramento Kings in front of a sellout crowd of 19,691 Saturday night at the Moda Center. \"It's an understatement to say that we're disappointed with the way that we played in the first quarter, first half,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"We didn't play like a desperate team, a team fighting for a playoff spot, and it's hard enough to win in this league, much less when you don't compete as hard as you need to compete.\" Portland is now 28-37 overall and 17-14 at home this season. The win is Sacramento's first in Portland in their last 12 tries, a streak dating back to the 2012-13 season. With the loss, the Blazers are now in a three-way tie for 10th in the West, four and a half game behind the Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot with 17 games remaining. Despite the stakes, the Trail Blazers were thoroughly outplayed from start to finish Saturday night by a Kings team that entered the game essentially in a dead heat with Portland for ninth. But that close proximity in the standings would not result in a close contest on the court. Sacramento, thanks in large part to remarkably accurate three-point shooting that was due equality to good shots and poor defense, went up by as many as 19 points in the first quarter. \"Some (threes) were contested, some weren't,\" said Stotts. \"They were in a good groove, going into the game I was concerned with their three-point shooting, and they shot them well.\" It got worse in the second, with the Kings shooting 58 percent from the field and 9-of-12 from three in the quarter to take a 77-54 lead into the intermission. Portland got the lead down to 14 after a Mario Hezonja three with 2:11 to play in the third quarter, giving a brief impression that perhaps they might shake off the malaise and make a game of it. But any hope of a second-half rally was quickly extinguished by the Kings finishing the quarter by outscoring the Blazers 10-4 in the final two minutes of the third to push the advantage back to 20 by the start of the fourth. From there, all that was in question was how soon both coaches would pull their starters and how respectable the final score would look. \"I thought we played like a team that was coming home, like we was counting on being on our home floor to kind of go in our direction,\" said Damian Lillard. \"They came out aggressive, in attack mode, on fire and jumped out to a big lead.

After losing in Phoenix Friday night, the Trail Blazers evened the score and the season series with a 121-105 victory versus the Suns in front of a sellout crowd of 19,393 Tuesday night at the Moda Center. \"Good to have a win,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. The last two (losses) have been very frustrating, wee didn't play very well. I liked our focus, our effort the entire game... We need every win, that's obvious, but I like the way we played. The Trail Blazer are now 29-37 overall and 18-14 at home this season. With the win, along with a Grizzlies loss earlier in the evening, the Trail Blazers are now in a three-way tie for ninth, 3.5 games behind Memphis for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Blazers host the Grizzlies Thursday at the Moda Center. After getting run off the floor in the first half of their loss last week in Phoenix and turning in one of their poorest efforts of the season the next night versus the Kings, the Trail Blazers brought an intensity, particularly on the defensive end, not seen in their last two losses. \u201cI thought it was a really good defensive performance from the start of the game \u2013 we was locked in to what we needed to do defensively,\" said Damian Lillard. \"We went over a lot of stuff in practice yesterday. Coming off the game we had in Phoenix, it was obvious we wanted to come back and show a lot more consistency in a game that we really needed. We\u2019re trying to make this final push for the playoffs, we had to have this one and that\u2019s where it started at \u2013 on the defensive end.\u201d Between holding the Suns to 2-of-8 shooting from three, forcing four turnovers and Carmelo Anthony scoring 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting, the Trail Blazers went up by as many as 12 before taking a 36-38 advantage into the second quarter. \"I think for us the most important thing is communicating and giving maximum effort on defense,\" said Trevor Ariza, who spent most of the game trying to slow down Suns All-Star guard Devin Booker. \"When you are hitting shots and playing well offensively, I guess it\u2019s natural to play harder on defense but for us when the offense isn\u2019t clicking we have to figure and continue to stay locked in on the defensive end to give ourselves a chance to win.\" After a close game in the second and third, Portland pulled away in the fourth by ratcheting their defensive intensity back up to where it was in the first. The Blazers held the Suns to 33 percent shooting in the final 12 minutes while going 7-of-10 from three to outscore the visitors by 12 to come away with the 16-point victory. \"We were just more present, showing help, making them play in crowds. Our communication was much better,\" said Lillard. \"We just weren\u2019t as spaced out. It was an emphasis on us helping each other out, having a tight paint \u2013 box and elbows, closing out on shooters, making them put the ball on the floor, plays that they like to run, we scouted really hard. We didn\u2019t really change our coverages, we just kind of hammered home yesterday in practice exactly what we wanted to do and what it should look like if we do those things and we executed tonight.\u201d Damian Lillard led the Trail Blazers with 25 points on 8-of-17 shooting from the field, 5-of-10 shooting from three and 4-of-4 shooting from the line, seven. assists, five rebounds, three steals and two blocks in 40 minutes. CJ McCollum and Trevor Ariza both finished with 22 points six assists and aa block, though the former also added four assists. Carmelo Anthony scored 12 of his 21 points in the first quarter while also finishing with five assists, two steals and two blocks. Hassan Whiteside finished with yet another double-double of 16 points, 14 rebounds and also blocked two shots. Devin Booker led all scorers with 29 points on 25 shots. Dario Saric added 24 points and 11 rebounds in 38 minutes. \u2022 Portland shot 45-of-89 (50.6%) from the field, while Phoenix was 35-of-87 (40.2%). It was the 20th time this season that Portland shot 50% or better from the field. The Trail Blazers are 16-4 in those games. \u2022 Portland earned its ninth win by 15 or more points. \u2022 The Trail Blazers recorded nine steals and nine blocks while the Suns had three steals and five blocks. It was the fourth time this season that Portland recorded at least nine steals and nine blocks in the same game. \u2022 Portland had five players score 16 or more points for the second time this season (Feb. 6, vs. SAS). It was the fourth time this season that four Portland players scored 20-plus points. They are 4-0 in those games. \u2022 The Suns handed out 26 assists to the Trail Blazers\u2019 20. It was Portland\u2019s fifth-straight game with at least 20 assists. \"Every game is pretty much a game that we have to win.\" -- Trevor Ariza As previously noted, the Trail Blazers host the Grizzlies on Thursday in a game that is as close to a \"must-win\" for Portland's playoff chances as you can get with 16 games to play. \"At this point, they\u2019re the team that we\u2019re chasing,\" said Lillard. \"Sixteen games left and that would basically be like winning two games, so it\u2019s a game on our home floor, a game that we\u2019re more than capable of winning. We\u2019ve got to just come prepared, come sharp and just get it done. That\u2019s what it comes down to.\" Tipoff is scheduled for Thursday at 7 p.m. "}

They hit big threes, they got offensive rebounds, did enough to beat us and they got off to a great start.\" The Trail Blazers are now 28-36 overall and 11-23 on the road this season. Portland had a chance to make up ground in the race for the eighth-seed with the Grizzlies losing to the Mavericks earlier in the evening, but with the loss, Portland remains 3.5 games back for the final playoff spot in the West with 18 games to play. Despite the Suns entering the game having lost four straight and the Trail Blazers desperately needing a win to keep pace in the Western Conference playoff race, it was Monty Williams' squad that wanted it more in the first quarter. Suns center Aron Baynes made two three-pointers in the early going and the Blazers started the game shooting 2-of-8 from the field to give Phoenix a 17-5 lead with 7:23 to play in the first quarter. Phoenix would go up by as many as 16 points in the first quarter, thanks in large part fo 19 points on 6-of-7 shooting from the field and 5-of-5 shooting from three for Baynes, before taking a 34-22 advantage into the second quarter. \"Baynes had a career night,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"He got hot and kind of kept us off balance the rest of the night. You expect him to make some threes but you don't expect him to make that many.\" Suns outscored the Blazers 22-11 in the first six minutes of the second quarter to take a 56-33 lead, and at that point, one could be forgiven for assuming there was no reason to continue paying attention. But the Trail Blazers responded with a 20-0 run to cut the Suns lead to 61-56 with a minute to play in the first half. Phoenix answered by outscoring Portland 8-2 in the final 40 seconds to take a 67-68 lead into the intermission. And in the third, the Suns went 17-0 to take the largest lead of the game at 88-62 with 5:55 to play in the quarter. Portland answered again, going on a 12-0 run to cut Phoenix's lead to 13 with just over two minutes to play in the third. Though the Trail Blazers would never really recover after starting the fourth with an over-and-back followed by allowing another wide open Baynes three. Phoenix went up by 23 after a Devin Booker three with 8:15 to play, and while Portland managed to go on numerous short runs in the fourth, they never got closer than the final deficit of 10 points. \"I can assure you we were trying to win, just didn't play well,\" said McCollum. \"They came out with more energy, they made shots, we didn't shoot the ball particularly well to start and then we got behind the eight ball. They jumped out, we had some turnovers, they were able to get out and run to get easy baskets and pulled away multiple times throughout the night.\" McCollum led the Blazers with 25 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and 3-of-8 shooting from three to go with eight assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block in just under 39 minutes. Damian Lillard went 6-of-16 from the field, 3-of-7 from three and 9-of-10 from the line to finish with 24 points and six assists in his second game back after missing six games with a right groin strain. Hassan Whiteside finished with 23 points, 20 rebounds and four blocks in 40 minutes. Trevor Ariza rounded out Portland's double-digit scorers with 17 points to go with five rebounds and three assists in 36 minutes. Baynes led all scorers with 37 points on 12-of-23 shooting from the field and 9-of-14 shooting from three to go with 16 rebounds and two blocks in 36 minutes. Devin Booker added 23 points and 12 assists for the double-double, while Ricky Rubio finished one of his own with 13 points, 10 assists in 33 minutes. Dario Saric went 9-of-13 for 24 points and Mikal Bridges shot 70 percent from the field on the way to 18 points. Next up, the Trail Blazers head back to Portland to play their next six games starting with the second of a back-to-back versus the Kings Saturday night at the Moda Center.

Nurkic returned to practice on Jan. 23, and he\u2019s been itching to rejoin his teammates in game action. \u201cI worked my ass off to be in position to get back on the court and help my team, but game speed is going to be different,\u201d Nurkic told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be playing 40 minutes. But for me, mentally, I need to get these reps in before I can play [extended minutes]. Physically, I\u2019m good. I had a calf strain recently, which is normal for the injury I had. I\u2019ve been pleased with where my rehab is going. I never doubted I\u2019d be back, but I had to make sure I was 100 percent.

[...] \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of ups and downs, but I\u2019ve been there before. There were struggles and fun times, but mainly during my rehab I was focused on how I could get back to normal.

Jab steps into jumpers. Three to the dome. Baseline fadeaways in the post. Head-butting the ball after made baskets. Wearing a wide headband on the court and designer labels off of it. Stay Me7o. All those small parts of Anthony's game and personality that he's become known for during the course of his Hall of Fame career made the move with him to Portland, bringing both skill and levity to a season that has often times been short on both. And of course, there's Carmelo's on-court talk, specifically his exclamations when he intends on grabbing a defensive rebound. Much like calling for a pop fly in baseball, Anthony has become known for yelling out three words that have become something of a catchphrase to make everyone well aware that he intends on grabbing a rebound. \"F@#&amp; OUTTA HERE\" (which will heretofore be shortened to \"FOH\" for the sake of the children). Carmelo doesn't remember exactly when he started yelling out expletives to let his teammates know when he's in position to grab a rebound, but he very clearly recalls why he started. \"I've played on team where guys, I won't say steal rebounds, but guys was real intense when going for the rebound,\" said Anthony. \"You had to really go get it and so I figured the way I could let everybody know that I'm going to get the rebound is saying that. It just happened.\" It's a habit that continues on to this day, and has become such a part of Carmelo's on-court routine that he says sometimes he doesn't even realize he's yelling \"FOH\" while going up for the rebound. But it seems to be working, as Anthony is grabbing 6.4 rebounds per game this season, the most he's averaged since the 2015-16 season, his penultimate with the New York Knicks. What's more, Anthony's rebounding numbers have ticked up despite playing alongside Hassan Whiteside, who is second in the league in rebounding this season at 14.2 boards per game. It's something of an unwritten rule in the NBA that centers get first crack at uncontested rebound, but Anthony and Whiteside have come to an understanding, partially due to Carmelo's flag-planting. \"I'd rather have a guy rebounding down there than not rebounding, so it's all good,\" said Whiteside. \"I always seen it on TV, but he be doing it to me a lot. I joke with him, I tell him I'd lead the league in rebounds if it weren't for him. I be joking with him, he do it by hisself.\" In general, NBA players love to put up stats -- the lengths some player will go in order to complete a triple-double is proof enough of this trait -- so it would be naive to think there wasn't some part of Anthony's rebounding histrionics that can be traced to a desire to pad numbers. But there are also some very valid reasons for making sure there's no confusion about who is doing what on the court. \"I think it's a good thing, the fact that I can attack the defensive rebound like that or just go rebound like that,\" said Anthony. \"But it also puts everybody on alert. I have this rebound, same team, don't come knock it out the hands. It alleviates a lot of those issues.\" Few things are more frustrating in an NBA game than two players on the same team going for a rebound, only to have the ball go out of bounds in the tussle and be awarded to the other team. Carmelo's verbalizing his intent helps lessen the chances of that happening. \"He's done it for a while now, and it's a great thing that he's doing because it communicates with your teammate, let them know get the FOH, I got the rebound,\" said Gary Trent Jr. \"There's so many times when you see both guys go for it or fighting for it or it goes out of bounds. Doing that clears up the confusion.\" It also provides some amusement to Portland's bench. Being around a player of Carmelo's reputation is in and of itself a treat for the players, and getting a front row seat to watch him do the same things in his 17th season that he was doing in his seventh is a bonus not lost on the players, especially those who have been watching him play for the majority of their lives. \"It's just what he does but to us it's a little bit comical every time he does it,\" said rookie Nassir Little. \"The funniest ones be where nobody is around him and he be like 'FOH!' Who you talking to? You the only one on defense right now! Those be the funniest ones, uncontested and he still say it. We get a little chuckle on the bench every time. \"The way he rebounds it, it's so elaborate. He slaps the ball, he jumps hard, lands heavy, that's what makes it so funny to me.\" And as for his more veteran teammates, they see it as not only a bit comical, but as a way to stay motivated after grabbing 7,240 rebounds over the course of 1,111 career games. \"It did start off as funny when I first heard it,\" said Trevor Ariza. \"Obviously he knows the mic is up underneath the basket. It just became a thing that grew for him, something he does. Maybe for him it keeps him locked in, it gives him another element to look forward to to make the game a little bit more competitive for him.\" After sitting out the majority of the 2018-19 season, there were significant concerns about whether Anthony would ever play again in the NBA, let along be an important contributor. But his play this season with the Blazers has quelled those concerns, so much so that he's likely to have a number of offers this offseason after starting the 2019-20 season as a free agent. At his current level of play, Anthony could be yelling \"FOH\" on NBA courts well into the 2020s. \"It wasn't something that was planned, it just started to happen,\" said Anthony. \"I enjoy it, I like it, I like when other guys go get the rebound. But if it's same team, it's the same team.\" "}

Lillard's goal was to pick up right where he left off before the injury, and while he looked no worse for wear Wednesday night, he didn't exactly get off to the kind of hot start that has typified his 2019-20 season. He scored just three points on 1-of-3 shooting and played nine minutes rather than the full 12 minutes he usually sees in the first quarter. But with both Carmelo Anthony going 6-of-8 from thee field and 2-of-3 from three for 14 points, CJ McCollum going 3-of-5 for nine points and Trevor Ariza making both of his attempts from the field and two of three free throw attempts, the Trail Blazers didn't require a fast start from their All-Star guard. \u201cIt\u2019s an advantage for everybody when we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders like that and everybody\u2019s playing well,\" said Anthony. 'Everybody\u2019s feeling comfortable and confident with the style and the play and it\u2019s done in the flow of the game. I thought everybody was very confident tonight.\u201d After a slow start, Lillard joined the scoring barrage that was instigated by his fellow starters. The 6-3 guard went scored nine points, with three of those points coming on a \"Logo Lillard\" attempt, while the team as a whole shot 56 percent from the field in the second to take a 72-61 lead into the intermission. \"I thought I moved pretty well,\" said Lillard. \"I was able to do a lot of things. I didn\u2019t want to overdo it once I realized the kind of game we were playing. Our balance was good and we had a comfortable lead so I picked my moments to really explode and take off and cut hard and get in a stance and fight over screens, stuff like that. I didn\u2019t feel restricted, so I felt pretty good.: While Portland's percentage fell in the third quarter, getting production from the entire starting lineup continued unabated. McCollum and Hassan Whiteside each scored seven points and Lillard and Ariza each had six. And while none of Portland's reserves scored in the third, they, along with the starters, helped hold the Wizards to 18 points on 24 percent shooting in the quarter. Portland's balanced offensive attack resulted in the home team going up by as many as 24 points before taking a 100-79 advantage into the fourth quarter. The Wizards managed to cull the Blazers' lead considerably by the midway point of the quarter, but after a Gary Payton II layup cut the deficit to 11, Portland went on a 13-1 run to slam the door. \"Just being aware of what\u2019s going on, where to be, what the right play is and actually making it on time, I thought we just had that tonight,\" said Lillard. \"I think when you do that, guys get high quality looks and they\u2019re going to have a good chance to have a night like we did tonight. Obviously, that\u2019s hard to do all the time and when you can do it, the game should look like it did tonight \u2013 a pretty strong win for us.\" Carmelo Anthony led Portland with 25 points on 8-of-13 shooting from the field to go with five rebounds, two steals and an assist in 31 minutes. It was the fifth time this season that's he's scored at least 25 points in a game. CJ McCollum shot 50 percent from the field for 22 points, six rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes. Lillard also finished with 22 points and five assists whole also added two rebounds, two steals and a block in just under 32 minutes. Hassan Whiteside put up his 48th double-double of the season with 24 points and 16 rebounds to go with four blocks and two assists. Trevor Ariza rounded out Portland's double-digit scorers with 15 points on 3-of-5 shooting from the field, 2-of-4 shooting from three and 7-of-8 shooting from the line. Wizards guard Bradley Beal led all scorers with 29 points. Davis Bertans finished with 21 points and Rui Hachimura added 11. \u2022 Portland shot 42-of-81 (51.9%) from the field, while Washington was 40-of-103(38.8%). It was Portland\u2019s third straight game shooting better than 50% from the floor. \u2022 Portland had four players finish with at least 20 points for the third time this season, improving to 3-0 in those games. \u2022 The Trail Blazers finished 28-of-32 (87.5%) from the FT line, attempting at least 30free throws for the fifth time this season. \u2022 The Trail Blazers had 11 blocks, finishing with double-digit rejections for the eighth time this season. \u2022 Portland outscored the Wizards on the fast break, 21-12. \u2022 The Trail Blazers starters outscored the Washington starting five, 108-63. \"Usually I don\u2019t play (Carmelo) the whole first quarter, but he had bounce, it was good to see.\" -- Terry Stotts The Trail Blazers begin an important road-home back-to-back with a tilt versus the Suns Friday night in Phoenix.

The Trail Blazers are now 26-25 overall and 10-22 on the road this season. They have now lost three straight and six of their last seven. With the loss, Portland failed to win a road game in the month of February. The Trail Blazers are now tied with the Kings for 11th in the Western Conference and trail the Memphis Grizzlies by 3.5 games for eighth with 19 games to play. After taking a 28-23 lead into the second quarter, the Trail Blazers were outscored 40-28 in the second quarter and 44-34 in the third quarter to a Hawks team playing on the second night of a back-to-back. \"They scored well both in the second and third quarter,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"They had 84 points in those two quarters. They shot the three well. They scored in the paint. They got out in transition. They played the style of ball that they\u2019re used to playing.\" While Portland shot 50 percent from the field, they went just 8-of-28 from three. In contract, the Hawks, statistically the worst three-point shooting team in the league, went 18-of-42 from deep. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting the ball well,\" said CJ McCollum. \"A lot of them were open so that\u2019s a credit to them for making open shots, some of them were contested. Part of the game plan to try to stop Trae Young is to make other guys beat us and they did tonight.\u201d That discrepancy in made three-pointers more than made up for the fact that the Trail Blazers actually made more shots from the field than Atlanta and shot almost the same number of free throws, all while still losing by double-digits. McCollum led all scorers with 35 points on 14-of-26 shooting, five rebounds, five assists and two steals in just under 39 minutes. Hassan Whiteside put up a double-double of 21 points and 13 rebounds in 31 minutes. Gary Trent Jr, who started in his fifth straight game in place of Damian Lillard (right groin strain), finished with 15 points on 50 percent shooting. Carmelo Anthony added 12 and Trevor Ariza finished with 10. Anfenee Simons came off the bench to finish with 10 points, though he left the game in the fourth quarter with a left ankle sprain and did not return. Hawks guard Trae Young finished with 25 points and a game-high 15 assists. John Collins went for a double-double with 24 points, 10 rebounds. De'Andre Hunter put up 22 points and Kevin Huerter added 19 points and eight assists.

It didn't work out that way, but the Trail Blazers guards in attendance Monday night more than made up for Lillard's absence. CJ McCollum and Gary Trent Jr. combined for 65 points to lead the Trail Blazers to a 130-107 victory over the Magic in front of a crowd of 18,078 Monday night at Amway Center in Orlando. \"I like the way we moved the ball,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"I thought we just played a solid game from start to finish.\" The Trail Blazers are now 27-35 overall and 11-22 on the road this season. The Blazers have swept the season series versus the Magic and have now won seven straight versus the Eastern Conference club. With the win, the Trail Blazers move up to ninth in the Western Conference standings and are 3.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot with 20 games to play. After losses to the Pacers and Hawks in the first two games of the trip, Portland needed to come away with a win Monday night to head home with some confidence and avoid falling further back in the standings. McCollum more than did his part in avoiding a winless trip in the first quarter, going 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-5 from three for 17 first-quarter points. \"We wanted to get at least one going back,\" said McCollum. \"We dropped two of them, we felt like we should have won at least one of those two. We didn't, that's our reality, so now we had to try to right some of our wrongs and get one before we go back home.\" But while getting off to a good start versus the Magic -- Portland scored the first seven points of the game and went on a 13-0 run late in the first quarter -- was certainly preferable to the alternative, the same could have been said of the previous games in Indianapolis and Atlanta, and both of those contests ended in losses. But rather than being outplayed in the second quarter once the game got turned over to an already injury-depleted bench, something that happened in the previous two losses, Portland actually extended their lead in the second 12 minutes of Monday's game. McCollum, Hassan Whiteside and Mario Hezonja, who had one of his best games of the season playing against one of his former teams, each contributed six points in the quarter while the team as a whole shot nearly 60 percent from the field. Even with Orlando guard Terrence Ross going 5-of-10 from the field and 3-of-8 from three for 13 second-quarter points, Portland took an 11-point lead into the half while scoring 69 points, the most the Magic had allowed in a first half this season. But while second quarters haven't been kind to the Blazers as of late, third quarters haven't been much better. So when the Blazers were outscored by seven while shooting under 40 percent in the third, the chances of suffering another second-half collapse and subsequently heading back to Portland empty-handed improved considerably. But so has Gary Trent Jr. The second-year guard out of Duke has made steady progress all season, but has lifted his game to another level since assuming a starting role in place of Lillard. That was especially true in the fourth quarter of Monday night's game. With McCollum on the bench, Trent Jr. went to work, scoring on a combination of drives, pullups and three-pointers. \"When you're missing a player like Damian Lillard, we have to win collectively as a group,\" said Trent Jr. \"CJ is a great scorer, a great player, so when he's not out there we've got to feed off each other. We've got to feed off each other to score and that's what we did.\" Trent Jr. would go on to score 14 points in the fourth on 5-of-7 shooting from the field, 2-of-3 shooting from three and 2-of-2 from the free throw line. \"That's what you work hard for,\" said Trent Jr. \"The fourth quarter, you're relatively tired, been playing the whole game, that's when you've got to lock in. That's why you put in hours, that's why you put reps into it. Just having a certain mentality to not let fatigue take you away from the mental aspect or it or the physical part.\" With Trent Jr. rolling, McCollum going 4-of-6 in under 6 minutes for nine fourth-quarter points, Trevor Ariza completing a four-point play, Caleb Swanigan holding Orlando's post players in check and Hezonja holding his own as a ball handler, Portland outscored Orlando by 19 in the fourth to pull away for the 23-point victory and their first road win since January. \"I thought Gary Trent did a nice job, offensively I thought we moved the ball,\" said Stotts. \"Caleb Swanigan in the second half made a lot of nice basketball plays. Mario Hezonja played an excellent game, both halves. With CJ out he became more of a playmaker, a facilitator and it was good to see. Mario\u2019s capable of playing like that.\" McCollum led all scorers with 41 points on 14-of-26 shooting from the field, 6-of-12 shooting from three and 7-of-7 shooting from the line to go with five assists, five rebounds and a steal in 35 minutes. McCollum has now made at least three three-pointers in the last 10 games, matching a franchise best. \"That's what CJ does, he does it day in and day out,\" said Trent Jr. \"You see him work on it every day in practice so when it comes to game time, it looks as effortless and as flawless as it does, it's no surprise.\" Trent Jr. shot 9-of-16 from the field for 24 points to go with three rebounds, two assists and a block in 34 minutes. The Duke product is averaging 12.7 points on 47 percent shooting from the field and 42 percent shooting from three in his last 10 games. \"Gary has had a really good season and he's gotten better as the season has gone along,\" said Stotts. \"We need it, frankly. Without Damian, we needed him. But now when Damian comes back, he's gained a lot of confidence and I continue to say about Gary is that as much as you look at his shot-making, his defense has kept him on the court more often than not.\" Hassan Whiteside finished with a double-double of 16 points and 13 rebounds in 26 minutes. Carmelo Anthony added 10 points, eight rebounds and two assists and Ariza finished with 11 points in 36 minutes. Hezonja was instrumental in the win, finishing with 10 points, eight rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes while finishing with a plus/minus of +22. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic in both scoring (30) and rebounding (11). Ross finished with 23 points off the bench. With the three-game trip now complete, the Trail Blazers head home to Portland, where they'll play seven of their next eight. First up, a Wednesday night tilt versus the Washington Wizards at the Moda Center. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. "}

The second half, however, left far more to be desired. After taking a six-point lead after the first two quarters, the Trail Blazers were outscored 63-51 in the second half to come away with a 106-100 loss to the Pacers in front of a crowd of 16,872 Thursday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. \u201cI thought we played a really good game,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"Defensively for the most part, we were solid. The second quarter was outstanding defensively. The third quarter, the fouls and the free throws, affected that quarter but we made a nice comeback. We gave up too many loose balls, too many long rebounds in the fourth quarter.\" The Trail Blazers are now 26-34 overall and 10-21 on the road this season. The loss also breaks Portland's five-game winning streak versus Indiana, a run that included back-to-back season series sweeps. The Blazers are now three games behind the Grizzlies for the eighth-seed in the West with 22 games to play. Despite playing their fourth straight game without Damian Lillard (right groin strain), the Trail Blazers got Thursday's game off to an impressive start. Though they trailed by six after the first quarter, Portland held the Pacers to 13 points in the second and went on a 10-1 run to take 49-43 lead into the intermission. But the Pacers flipped the game in the third, going on a 9-0 run to tie the game at 60-60 after a Victor Oladipo three-pointer midway through the quarter. Indiana would follow up that run with a 13-3 rally at the end of the quarter, and would eventually outscore Portland 37-26 to take a 70-65 lead into the fourth and final. \"I think the game kind of got slowed down, a bunch of fouls, free throws,\" said Carmelo Anthony. \"It was kind of bogged down in that third quarter. They want to play a style like that in the halfcourt, stop the clock and foul. I think that where it when when they went on their run.\" The Pacers took their largest lead of the night at 96-82 after a T.J. Warren three with just over six minutes to play, and from there, it looked as though the night might be just about over for the remnants of Portland's regular rotation. Rather than calling it a night, the Blazers managed to chip away at the advantage over the next five minutes, getting the lead down to 100-103 after a McCollum floater with 30 seconds to play. But on the ensuing possession, Domantas Sabonis found Turner wide open for a three, which he made with 9.1 seconds to play, to ice the game. \u201cThey went on a run, we had some turnovers, I had a couple turnovers and they got out and got easy baskets and got to the free throw line,\" said CJ McCollum. \"Some of it was fouls, some of it was questionable, but they still shot free throws. In the fourth quarter they just beat us.\" McCollum led all scorers with 28 points on 11-of-27 shooting from the field while also adding eight assists and three rebounds in 38 minutes. Gary Trent Jr, starting in his fourth game in place of Damian Lillard, went 7-of-15 from thee field and 4-of-8 from three for 20 points to go with five rebounds and a steal in just under 41 minutes. Hassan Whiteside put up yet another double-double with 18 points and 16 rebounds while also blocking four shots. Carmelo Anthony finished with 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting and seven rebounds. Six Pacers finished in double figures led by Domantas Sabonis, who overcame foul trouble in the first half to finish with 20 points, 11 rebounds and four assists. Malcom Brogdon finished with 17 points, eight assists and both T.J. Warren and Victor Oladipo added 15 points. Next up, the Trail Blazers head to Atlanta to finish their season series versus the Hawks Saturday night. Tipoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. "}

The 6-3 point guard in his eighth season out of Weber State has missed the last three games with a strained right groin and will miss at least the next two games versus the Pacers and Hawks. However, he has not been ruled out entirely from playing at some point on the trip. \u201cDame obviously didn\u2019t make the trip,\u201d said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \u201cIf he feels better he may meet us up or he may stay there for the whole trip.\u201d Portland is 1-4 this season without Lillard in the lineup. Then there\u2019s Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins, both of whom did travel with the team to Indianapolis despite neither being expected to play during the three-game Eastern Conference swing. While neither participated in Wednesday\u2019s shootaround, both were in attendance and went through weight training. Collins said he was scheduled for an on-court workout before Thursday\u2019s game versus the Pacers. \u2022 The Trail Blazers have bested the Pacers in the last five games between the two teams, including a 139-129 victory in the most recent meeting in Portland on January 26. But the Trail Blazers got 50 points and 13 assists from Damian Lillard in that victory while Victor Oladipo, Myles Turner and Malcom Brogdan all sat out for Pacers, making Thursday\u2019s game a much more daunting task for the visitors. \u201cThey\u2019re good at a little bit of everything,\u201d said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got really good shooters on the perimeter, they\u2019ve got a couple point guards that run the show well. They\u2019ve got versatile big guys \u2014 Sabonis had an All-Star year, he\u2019s effective inside \u2014 Turner, who did not play against us last time is inside/outside. So they just have a little bit of everything and they\u2019re very well coached.\u201d After losing six straight before the All-Star break, the Pacers have won three of their last four and are currently sixth in the Eastern Conference standings, just 1.5 games behind the Pacers for fifth and two behind the Heat for fourth. \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d said CJ McCollum. \u201cObviously they suffered a tough injury with Lamb \u2014 I wish him a speedy recovery \u2014 but they\u2019ve got a good roster. They\u2019re strong, they got an All-Star back in Oladipo and they\u2019re deep, so we\u2019ve got to be ready to play.\u201d \u2022 If the playoffs started today, the Trail Blazers, currently in ninth place, would miss the postseason for the first time since 2013. But luckily for the Blazers, the playoffs start in roughly seven weeks, meaning they\u2019ve still got plenty of opportunities to get into the Top 8 in the West. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique challenge,\u201d said McCollum of Portland\u2019s position with 23 games left to play. \u201cObviously you\u2019d like to have clinched like the Milwaukee Bucks a week ago, but this is our reality and it\u2019s important you grow from these moments. I think it\u2019s important when you go through trials and tribulations and struggles. It helps build character and I think this is a great character building season for us and can end in a better way than we thought based on the last few weeks.\u201d Portland trails Memphis, a team that has now lost four straight, by 1.5 games for the eighth and final playoff spot, so even with. injuries remaining an issue and a defense that ranks in the lower third of the league, the Blazers are still in position to make the postseason. But they\u2019re also just a half game up on a surging Pelicans squad, lead the Kings and Spurs by on games and the Suns by two games, so they\u2019ve got to be just as concerned about holding off those teams behind as they do about overtaking those in front. \u201cI would love to get (to the playoffs), I want to get there and I think that\u2019s what makes kind of this next run of 20-something games that we have important, but also fun, too,\u201d said Carmelo Anthony. \u201cGet a chance to just be involved in that, and if we do make it, the story that would be able to be told about that. The way that we fought back, the way that we persevered through injuries and things like that that\u2019s out of our control, I would love that.\u201d "}

I liked the way our guys competed, we didn\u2019t take advantage of some of our opportunities, but other than that I thought we gave a good effort.\u201d The Trail Blazers are now 26-33 overall and 16-13 at home this season. With the loss, the Trail Blazers trail the Memphis Grizzlies by three games for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference with 23 games to play. In a battle between two teams who get almost the entirety of their scoring from their starters, the Celtics got more production from their five five than the Trail Blazers to come away with the victory. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combined for 60 points, Marcus Smart and Gordon Hayward and each added 12 points and Daniel Theis fell just short of a double-double with 10 points and nine boards. And while Portland's starters, or at least those who have filled in due to injuries, comported themselves admirably -- CJ McCollum turned in his third straight game with at least 10 assists, Hassan Whiteside came close to another 20/20 game and Trevor Ariza missed just one of his shots from the field, three and the free throw line -- they couldn't match Boston's production. Though they had a few opportunities. In the first half, Portland went on an 11-3 run to cut a 10-point deficit down to three late in the second quarter. But the Celtics, as they would do all night, answered with a mini-run of their own, scoring seven in a row to push the lead back to double digits. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get stops,\" said McCollum. \"They went on a couple runs and we weren\u2019t able to sustain a high enough level of play to win.\" After Boston took an eight-point advantage into the intermission, CJ McCollum opened the second half with a three-pointer that cut the lead to 56-51. But Portland would never come any closer than that. Boston took a 10-point lead off a Tatum layup with 5:25 to play in the third and went up by as many as 19 in the fourth before coasting to a 12-point victory. \u201cWe have to be better than we played tonight against teams like the Celtics to win,\" said McCollum. \"I think that was the difference. They played better than us. They\u2019re a deep team. They made shots, they got stops, they ran on our turnovers and they played like a playoff team.\" CJ McCollum finished with 28 points, four rebounds, 10 assists and three blocks in 38 minutes. With the performance, he joins Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Trae Young and LeBron James as the only players who score at least 25 points and hand out at least 10 assists in three straight games this season. Hassan Whiteside went 8-of-12 from the field for 18 points to go with 19 rebounds, three assists and a block in 36 minutes. Trevor Ariza went 5-of-6 from the field, 2-of-2 from three and 5-of-5 from the free throw line for 17 points while also tallying eight rebounds, two assists and two steals in 37 minutes. Carmelo Anthony added 14 points to round out Portland's double-digit scorers. Boston's Jayson Tatum led all scorers with 36 points on 14-of-22 shooting from the field and 8-of-12 shooting from three. Jaylen Brown went for 124 points, seven rebounds and two assists. \u2022 Boston was 19-of-39 (48.7%) from 3-PT range, while Portland shot 13-of-31 (41.9%)from deep. The Celtics\u2019 19 made three-pointers were a season-high, while Portland shot over 40% from long range for the second straight game. \u2022 The Trail Blazers dished out 24 assists to Boston\u2019s 19. It was Portland\u2019s sixth straight game recording at least 20 assists. \u2022 Portland outscored Boston 42-38 in the paint, and 26-23 in transition. \u2022 The Celtics outrebounded the Trail Blazers 45-41, with both teams recording eight offensive rebounds. \u2022 Portland made 17 free-throws to Boston\u2019s 13. \u201cIt\u2019s our reality so we\u2019ve got to figure out how to get as many wins as possible starting in Indiana and progressing forward.\" -- CJ McCollum on the upcoming three-game trip With a three-game homestand now completed, the Trail Blazers hit the road for three straight games, all versus teams from the Eastern Conference.

Between injuries and issues on the defensive end, the Blazers have yet to go on the kind of extended run that has resulted in playoffs berths in each of the last six seasons. And with 24 games to play and Damian Lillard joining the ranks of the inactive, the prospects of a late-season rally would seem to be in jeopardy. At 26-32, the Trail Blazers find themselves in ninth-place in the West, 2.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the final playoffs spot, and with one of the easiest post All-Star break schedules in the league, they're still in good position to string some wins together. But they're also just a half game up on the Pelicans, one game up on the Spurs and two games up on the Suns and Kings, meaning they're actually closer to 12th place then they are to eighth. So if a playoff push is going to happen, it's got to start sooner rather than later. And with a home-heavy schedule -- Portland plays eight of their next 12 games at the Moda Center -- they've got a chance to make up some ground before heading out for a six-game road trip at the end of March. Here's where the Trail Blazers stand in the weekly Power Rankings with just under two months to play in the regular season... \u2022 The panel of voters at ESPN have the Trail Blazers at No. 18 this week, two spots worse than last week... It wasn't technically a must-win game against the Pistons on Sunday, but let's call it a you'd-better-not-lose contest. And the Trail Blazers didn't, squeaking by behind 41 points from CJ McCollum and 32 from Carmelo Anthony. They are four games behind Memphis in the loss column for the eighth playoff spot in the West, and they're running out of time. Damian Lillard is coming back from his groin injury soon, but the Blazers are probably going to need another miraculous run from him to close the gap. The schedule is pretty favorable to close, but as inconsistent as Portland has been, that might not even matter. The folks at ESPN have the Trail Blazers behind the Spurs at No. 17 and ahead of the Magic at No. 19. \u2022 John Schuhmann at NBA.com has the Trail Blazers at No. 17 this week, unchanged from last week... Pace: 101.2 (11) OffRtg: 111.5 (11) DefRtg: 113.5 (27) NetRtg: -1.9 (19) The Blazers were without Damian Lillard (who may miss another game or two) as they came out of the All-Star break. But they didn't necessarily need their point to start defending better than they did between Christmas and the All-Star break (when they ranked last defensively). Alas, they began their post-break schedule by allowing the Pelicans to score 73 points on 53 possessions in the first half on Friday and complete a season sweep with a wire-to-wire victory. The Blazers' win over the Pistons two nights later came with a season-high 32 points from Carmelo Anthony, who made as many 3-pointers on Sunday (five) as he had in four games vs. New Orleans. The victory has the Blazers holding onto in ninth place and began a stretch of six straight games vs. the Eastern Conference. But it came after they blew a 19-point lead, getting outscored by 14 points in less than five minutes with CJ McCollum off the floor. An empty-side, pick-and-pop for Anthony (either with Lillard or McCollum as the ball-handler has been a go-to set for the Blazers) provided the dagger on Sunday. Schuhmann has the Trail Blazers behind the Nets at No. 16 and ahead of the Kings at No. 18. \u2022 Colin Ward-Henninger at CBS Sports has the Trail Blazers at No. 18 this week, one spot worse than last week... Portland lost to the Pelicans for the fourth time this season to start the week, giving New Orleans the tiebreaker if the teams are dead even for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. They bounced back to beat the Pistons behind 41 points, 12 asssits and nine rebounds from CJ McCollum, and 32 points from Carmelo Anthony with Damian Lillard still out of the lineup with a groin injury. Portland now sits three games out of the eighth seed, but only 2.5 games up on the No. 13 Suns. The Pelicans actually had the tiebreaker after winning the third game, but who's counting. Also interesting to consider the Blazers are currently closer to 13th than they are to 8th. Ward-Henninger has the Trail Blazers behind the Spurs at No. 17 and ahead of the Kings at No. 19. \u2022 Tommy Beer at Rotoworld has the Trail Blazers at No. 17 this week, two spots down from last week... With Damian Lillard (groin strain) sidelined, the Blazers needed strong games from their supporting cast Sunday night vs. Detroit. And that's just what they got. Carmelo Anthony scored a season-high 32 points (on only 16 FG attempts), C.J. McCollum recorded a season-high 41 points, a season-high nine rebounds, and a career-high 12 assists, while Hassan Whiteside chipped in 16 points, 17 rebounds, three assists and four blocks. Beer has the Trail Blazers behind the Nets at No. 16 and ahead of the Spurs at No. 18. \u2022 Zach Harper at The Athletic has the Trail Blazers at No. 21 this week, another two-spot drop from last week... Without Lillard in the lineup, the loss to New Orleans was totally justified. But they still lost to a team they can\u2019t really afford to lose to. Portland is missing Dame for a few games, and that could very well decide their season. They won\u2019t tank or punt on the season any time soon, but I hope they\u2019re extra careful with Lillard and look long-term with his situation. Getting hurt while clawing for the 8-seed only to get obliterated by the Lakers in the first-round doesn\u2019t seem to be worth the risk. Harper has the Trail Blazers behind the Suns at No. 20 and ahead of the Wizards at No. 22. \u2022 Phil Watson at Hoops Habit has the Trail Blazers at No. 20 this week, unchanged from last week... The Portland Trail Blazers opened their second half with a thud Friday night, getting beaten handily at home by the Pelicans for their third consecutive loss. It was Portland\u2019s fourth loss in five games and was their first game since losing Damian Lillard to a groin injury. He\u2019s expected to be out another three or four games. Lillard is averaging 29.5 points per game, fourth-best in the NBA, but had to pull out of both the Three-Point Shootout and the All-Star Game because of the groin injury. CJ McCollum took on the load with the scoring and playmaking in the loss to the Pelicans, finishing with 27 points, 10 assists and six rebounds in 37 minutes while hitting 10-of-22 overall and making 3-of-8 from 3-point range. McCollum is on pace for his fifth straight season averaging at least 20 points per game, currently putting in 21.4 a night over 53 games. Watson has the Trail Blazers behind the Grizzlies at No. 19 and ahead of the Pistons at No. 21. \u2022 Michael Shapiro at \"Sports Illustrated\" has the Trail Blazers at No. 15 this week, unchanged from last week... When searching for an answer for Portland\u2019s slide in the Western Conference this season, a simple answer arises on the boards. The Blazers are No. 27 in defensive rebounding and just three spots better in rebounding percentage, consistently losing the boards battle on a given night. This shouldn\u2019t be the case for a team with a mammoth center, but as is usually the case with Hassan Whiteside, his individual statistics far outpace his team impact. Jusuf Nurkic\u2019s absence has been crushing after a run to last year\u2019s Western Conference finals. And Rodney Hood's. And Zach Collins'. Shapiro has the Trail Blazers behind the Grizzlies at No. 15 and ahead of the Pelicans at No. 16. \u2022 Andy Bailey at Bleacher Report put the Trail Blazers at No. 19 this week, a two-spot drop from last week... The next few weeks of Blazers basketball could make or break the season. \"Damian Lillard (right groin strain) did not practice today,\" Portland reporter Casey Holdahl revealed Thursday, \"said he thinks he might miss three or four games.\" The Blazers have already dropped one crucial game to the New Orleans Pelicans since that news. If they continue to slip against the string of Eastern Conference teams they have coming up, their playoff chances could be doomed. Over the course of this season, Portland is plus-1.4 points per 100 possessions with Dame on the floor and minus-10.4 with him off. The question now becomes whether Lillard travels with the team on their three-game road trip starting Thursday in Indianapolis versus the Pacers. Bailey has the Trail Blazers behind the Magic at No. 18 and ahead of the Kings at No. 20. "}

The way we started was fun to watch, at both ends,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"Obviously we struggled in the second quarter, primarily defensively, kind of set the tone. But look at what we did to win the game, fourth quarter defense was outstanding.\" The Trail Blazers are now 26-32 overall and 16-12 at home this season. The win ends a three-game losing streak and is their third straight home win versus the Pistons. Portland remains in ninth place in the Western Conference standings and are three games behind the Grizzlies for eighth and a half game up on the Pelicans for 10th. The start of the first quarter didn't give one the impression that the Trail Blazers were likely to break the game open early. The Pistons scored the first five points while the Trail Blazers came out listless, airballed their first attempt, a three-pointer, before turning the ball over on the next possession. But not long later, both CJ McCollum and Carmelo Anthony seemed to recognize their respective talents on offense were in excess of whatever the Pistons would be able to throw at them on defense. Soon thereafter, McCollum scored 10 points in roughly a minute and a half of play while Anthony made back-to-back three-pointers followed by an alley-oop finish on a feed from McCollum. \"CJ was terrific all night, but the first quarter in particular, he was outstanding,\" said Stotts. \"Melo got us off to a great start. First quarter was awesome.\" McCollum and Anthony would combine to score 27 points in the quarter while leading a 23-2 run that would help Portland take a 40-24 lead into the second quarter. But rather than packing it in, the Pistons nearly matched the Blazers' first-quarter run with one of their own in the second. Portland had just three points through the first seven minutes of the quarter, allowing Detroit to go on a 19-3 run, that included scoring 16 straight, to take a 47-45 lead with just under four minutes to play in the first half. \"Those guys just wasn't trying to go away,\" said Anthony of the Pistons. \"After we got out in the first quarter, we kind of let our foot off the gas and those guys got confidence. They gained some momentum, they stuck with it to the end of the game.\" Despite playing one of their worst quarters of the season, the Blazers managed to put together some semblance of offense late in the first half to score 13 points in the quarter while taking a 53-51 lead into the intermission. After the two teams took turns holding small leads for the first half of the third, the Pistons went on an 11-0 run to take their largest lead of the game at 83-73 with a minute to play in the quarter. Were it not for McCollum scoring the last seven of Portland's points in the third, they likely would have gone into the fourth worse off than the five-point deficit they faced. \"CJ was outstanding,\" said Stotts. \"You look at his assists, the way he managed the game. Obviously he scored the ball, but you take what he's done in the last two games with Dame out and it's been pretty impressive. Back-to-back double digit assists, he's scoring well, but obviously it's one of the better games he's played in.\" McCollum kept it going in the fourth, scoring 13 of his season-high 41 points in the final 12 minutes. And Anthony picked up where he left off in the first quarter as well, scoring eight points in the fourth on 3-of-4 shooting. \"We don't have a choice, we've got to go out there and do what we've got to do to help this team win, at least put ourselves in position to try to win a basketball game,\" said Anthony. \"At the end of the day, it's going to come down to (McCollum and myself) putting that pressure on us and saying 'This is what we've got to do.' It's the last quarter of the season, we're in a dog fight trying to get that spot.\" Add in Hassan Whiteside coming up with eight rebounds and two blocks, one of which came on what would have been a game-tying Derrick Rose layup with 40 seconds to play, and the Blazers as a whole holding the Pistons to 36 percent shooting in the quarter and the home team was able to overcome a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit to come away with the three-point win. CJ McCollum led all scorers with a season-high 41 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and 6-of-11 shooting from three. McCollum also added a career-high 12 assists and nine rebounds to come one short of the triple-double. It was his sixth career 40+ point game, the eighth double-double of his career and the first time he has recorded a double-double in consecutive games. Carmelo Anthony put up a season-high 32 points on 11-of-16 shooting from the field and 5-of-9 shooting from three. It was his 272nd career game with at least 30 points and is the most he's scored in almost three years. Hassan Whiteside put up his 43rd triple-double of the season with 16 points and 17 rebounds. He also added four blocks and three assists. Christian Woods came off the bench to lead the Pistons with 26 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes. Derrick Rose and Brandon Knight each finished with 15 and Langston Galloway added 13. \u2022 Portland was 41-of-84 (48.8%) from the field, while Detroit shot 37-of-86 (43.0%). It was the 28th time this season that Portland has had an equal or better FG% than the opponent. \u2022 The Trail Blazers starting lineup outscored Detroit\u2019s starters, 97-34. \u2022 The Trail Blazers dished out 20 assists to Detroit\u2019s 18. It was Portland\u2019s fifth consecutive game recording at least 20 assists. \u2022 Portland outscored Detroit 15-13 in second chance points, while the Pistons outscored the Trail Blazers in fast break points, 21-20. \u2022 Portland improved to 5-3 in games decided by three points or less. \u201cJust be aggressive, attack and do whatever we can to get a win.\u201d -- CJ McCollum on his mentality going into the fourth quarter The Trail Blazers finish up a three-game, post All-Star break homestand with a tilt versus the Boston Celtics Tuesday night at the Moda Center.

But even with Lillard, who currently ranks fourth in the NBA in scoring, sitting out, it was Portland's defense that was the larger issue, as has been the case for most of the 2019-20 season. The Pelicans shot better than 60 percent from the field and from three in the first half and finished the game shooting 53 percent overall on the way to a 128-115 wire-to-wire win over the Trail Blazers in front of a sellout crowd of 19,946 Friday night at the Moda Center. \"I thought it was a good effort by our team, just probably better defense through the first half, thought we had a better effort in the second half,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"That (12-0) run at the end of the third quarter really hurt us, a couple offensive rebounds, some bad offensive possessions hurt us, but bottom line is we found ways to score, but our defense still needs to get better.\" The Trail Blazers are now 25-32 overall and 15-12 at home this season. With the win, the Pelicans have swept the season series 4-0 while the Trail Blazers have lost three straight overall. The Blazers are now tied with Spurs for ninth in the West, though New Orleans is just a half game behind both teams. Portland remains 3.5 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. With Lillard joining Rodney Hood, Jusuf Nurkic, Zach Collins and Mario Hezonja on the inactive list, the Trail Blazers had just nine players in uniform for Friday night's contest. But despite their lack of numbers, the Trail Blazers had success slowing down the Pelicans in transition, something they failed to do in their loss in New Orleans last week, to start first quarter. But with no one to slow dynamic rookie Zion Williams, Brandon Ingram, fresh off his first All-Star Game appearance, going 3-of-5 from the field while also handing out four assists in the first quarter and the Pelicans shooting 68 percent from the field and 71 percent from three, the Trail Blazers found themselves down 12 before cutting the lead to 41-35 by the start of the second quarter. Portland's inability to slow New Orleans continued in the second quarter. They briefly got the lead down to two early in the second, though the Pelicans, as would be the case all evening, had an answer. New Orleans shot 55 percent from the field and logged nine assists on 11 made baskets take a 15-point lead after a Williamson layup with just over four minutes to play in the first half. The Blazers made what would ultimately be their last chance at a second-half rally midway through the third. After trailing by 10 at the half, Portland went on a 9-0 run to cut New Orleans' lead to 80-77 with 7:19 to play in the quarter. But the Pelicans responded by going 10-2 to push their advantage back up to double digits. \"I thought offensive wasn\u2019t the problem,\" said CJ McCollum. \"Defensive was the bigger problem. We figure out ways to score, we always have, we\u2019ve just got to tighten up at the other end.\u201d By the time the quarter ended, New Orleans had outscored Portland 22-6 over the last seven minutes of the third to take a 19-point lead into the fourth. The Pelicans took their largest lead of the game at 105-83 thanks to a Nicolo Melli three-pointer on the first possession of the quarter, and proceeded to hold the Trail Blazers at arm's length throughout the duration of the game. \u201cI think we competed but I think just some lapses defensively,\" said McCollum. \"We fouled a lot in the first half. I think they shot like 28, 29 free throws in the first half which is too many easy points so we\u2019ve got to tighten that up but overall, I thought we competed. Just didn\u2019t play well enough defensively to win.\" All five of Portland's starters finished in double figures Friday night with CJ McCollum leading the way with 27 points on 10-of-22 shooting from the field, 10 assists and five rebounds in 37 minutes. Carmelo Anthony went for 20 points, five rebounds, a block and an assist in 32 minutes. Hassan Whiteside finished with a double-double of 19 points and 12 rebounds while also blocking six shots. Gary Trent Jr, who started in place of Damian Lillard, added 15 points and Trevor Ariza finished with 13 points on just seven shots, eight rebounds, two assists and two steals in 35 minutes. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 25 points on 10-of-17 shooting from the field, though he also shot just 5-of-10 from the free throw line. Jrue Holiday added 20 points and nine assists. Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram combined for 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting and both Josh Hart and Nicolo Melli added 13 points off the bench. \u2022 All five of Portland starters scored in double figures for the seventh time this season. The Trail Blazers are 5-2 in those games. \u2022 The Trail Blazers blocked nine shots and had seven steals while New Orleans had three blocks and eight steals. \u2022 Portland shot 19-of-25 (76%) from the free throw line, while New Orleans was 20-of-33(60.6%) from the stripe. \u2022 Both teams recorded 48 points in the paint, and Portland outscored New Orleans in second chance points, 22-18. \u2022 New Orleans was 45-of-84 (53.6%) from the field, while Portland shot 43-of-94 (45.7%). The Pelicans also shot 52.9% from 3-PT range, marking the first time this season they have finished above 50% in both FG% and 3-PT%. \"He\u2019s bigger than everybody on the court and they do a great job of looking for him over the top and he jumps, he\u2019s got like a 45-inch vertical, it\u2019s unbelievable.\" -- Hassan Whiteside on Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson HIGHLIGHTS The Trail Blazers' post-break, three-game homestand continues with a contest versus the Detroit Pistons Sunday night at the Moda Center.

Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard suffered a right groin strain in the fourth quarter of Portland\u2019s 111-104 loss to the Grizzlies at FexEd Forum Thursday night. The injury occurred with 3:22 to play in the fourth quarter and with the Blazers trailing the Grizzlies 106-94. Lillard drove down the lane where he was met by Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas. Valciunas blocked Lillard's layup attempt, but as the 6-3 guard landed, he immediately grabbed his right groin. Initially, it was though that perhaps Lillard had take a shot to the midsection, though replays showed there was no contact. \"When it happened, I just felt it,\" said Lillard, who finished the game with 20 points, 10 assists and five rebounds in 37 minutes. \"I knew I pulled it, it made no sense to be out there for the last few minutes of the game and risk trying to play through it and making it worse. But I walked off the court just fine even though it was like, a little bit painful. I came in and it was strong when they was making me go against resistance and stuff like that. It was strong, wasn't like, weak and I couldn't do stuff. That was all I needed to know.\" Lillard said he will still travel to Chicago, where the 2020 All-Star festivities are being held, though he will not participate in either the All-Star Game -- he was selected by the coaches as a reserve and was \"drafted\" to play for Team LeBron James -- nor the three-point contest as previously scheduled. \"Obviously that's something that you look forward to, those festivities and having fun, but my health is first and I knew right away that wasn't going to happen,\" said Lillard. \"I'll still be there and be a part of it but I'm not going to be able to play. So hopefully somebody who should have been there who didn't make it (will go). Unfortunately, I had to be the fall guy, but hopefully Devin Booker or somebody like that will get the spot.\" While Lillard is a scratch for the competitive portions of All-Star Weekend, he was adamant that, with over a week of inactivity afforded by the All-Star break, that he would be able to return sooner rather than later. The Trail Blazers are currently four games behind the Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West with 26 games to play. \"It's a long way to go, we've got a lot of home games, we've got a lot of winnable games,\" said Lillard. \"Just know that I'm not gonna go away... After this break is over, it's on.\" "}
{"team": "blazers", "url": "https://www.nba.com/blazers/forwardcenter/portlands-yearly-playoff-push-starts-without-lillard", "date": "2020-02-21 00:00:00", "tags": ["Lillard, Damian", "Trail Blazers", "forward center", "ForwardCenter"], "article": "  Over the last decade, few teams have been as successful at making post All-Star break playoff pushes than the Portland Trail Blazers. And considering they're currently in ninth place in the West, one spot behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the last playoff spot, and have the second-easiest schedule in the NBA over the final 27 games, there's some reason to believe the Trail Blazers are in position to make yet another late-season rally. But if that is to be the case this season, they'll have to start that push without Damian Lillard. Lillard, who is averaging 29.5 points, 7.9 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 37.0 minutes per game this season, said after the team's practice in Tualatin on Thursday that he would likely miss the next three to five games with a right groin strain suffered in Portland's 111-104 loss to the Grizzlies in Memphis on February 12. \"I feel alright, I've been doing rehab since Thursday last week,\" said Lillard, who also sat out the All-Star Game and the Three-Point Shootout at the 2020 All-Star Weekend due to the injury. \"And it's gotten a lot better but I think it's just one of those things where you start feeling better right away but I think that last 15, 10 percent is what takes the time, that's what takes so long.\" Lillard underwent an MRI on February 13 in Chicago that confirmed the groin strain and at that point the team said his status would be re-evaluated in a week. The 6-3 point guard initially stated he would be back in time to play in Portland's first post All-Star break contest, a nationally-televised game versus the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night at the Moda Center, but the nature of the injury precluded such a quick turnaround. \"It's just one of those things that you can't just say 'Alright, I'm gonna play through it' because it could be bad,\" said Lillard, who sat out two games in November with back spasms. \"So you've got to take that time, that's pretty much all you can do, rehab, all the training. I've been doing all the training I could possibly do, so I'm sore as hell but I got to take time off to let it heal completely. But once that happens, I'll be back out there.\" Though the question now becomes: Where will the Trail Blazers be when Lillard is able to return? At 25-31 with 27 games to play, the Trail Blazers have had a difficult time stringing together wins this season even with Lillard turning in an MVP-caliber campaign, so turning their season around with their best player in street clothes would likely qualify as their most impressive late-season run under Terry Stotts. \"Just play hard, that's the biggest thing,\" said CJ McCollum of what they need to do to make up for the loss of Lillard. \"Dame does a lot for us offensively, calling plays, facilitating and scoring, so I'll have to do a little bit more of that. But at the same time, it's like one person isn't going to replace his production. We've got to all be better.\" Despite injuries, both to Lillard and those which have accumulated over the court of the season -- McCollum is the only starter from last year's team currently on the active list -- there is some cause for optimism. The Trail Blazers play more home games in the final two months of the regular season than any other Western Conference team and the Grizzlies, who are four games up in the loss column on the Trail Blazers for eighth place, have one of the toughest remaining schedules and play 16 of their 28 remaining games on the road. What's more, two of those road game are versus the Trail Blazers, giving Portland a chance to make up two full games in the event that they're able to defend homecourt. But if they're not able to come up with at least a few wins in Lillard's absence, any assistance that comes via breaks in the schedule won't be enough to make a difference. And the Pelicans, a team that has won all three previous meetings versus the Trail Blazers this season, are just a half game behind Portland and have one of the easiest remaining schedules, so just passing the Grizzlies, a difficult task in and of itself, might not be enough to make the postseason. So what little margin of error the Blazers had with Lillard in the lineup, if any existed in the first place, is gone with him out of it. If they're able to go .500 or better over the next three to give games without their starting point guard, they might very well put themselves in position to get into the Top 8 when he returns. If not, Portland's chances of making the postseason for the seventh straight year could be nearly snuffed out before Lillard gets back on the court. \"This is it, it's all or nothing. Earlier in the year we was like 'Oh, we got 50 games left. We got 40 games left.' Now it's 26 games, 15 at home and we need 16 to 20 of them and that's just what it is,\" said Lillard. \"I expect everybody to lift up their level of play in my absence just because of what we need to happen. We don't really have a choice right now so I wouldn't expect anything less.\" "}

As such, though the Portland Trail Blazers have played the New Orleans Pelicans twice this season, Tuesday at Smoothie King Center was the first time the Blazers have matched up with the 6\u20196\u201d prodigy. The Blazers entered Tuesday\u2019s matchup on the first half of a quick back-to-back road trip which will see them face the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. Both games even more important considering all three teams are within striking distance of the 8th seed heading into the All-Star Break. But Tuesday's matchup belonged to the Pelicans, who rode a career game from their star rookie to a 138-117 win in front of\u00a015,739 fans at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The Pelicans fed Williamson early in the contest, but with the NBA\u2019s leading shot blocker towering over him in the paint, New Orleans settled for kick-out jumpers. The aforementioned shot blocker, Hassan Whiteside, thrived on the other end, picking up 8 points and 4 rebounds in his first 6 minutes of play. The Blazers lockdown defense helped spark a 17-0 run with Trevor Ariza and Carmelo Anthony finishing fast breaks after steals on the perimeter. However, New Orleans found their shot near the end of the half going on a run of their own to narrow the lead. At the half, the Blazers led by just two, 65-63. The second half awkwardly opened with a missed free throw by Jrue Holiday after Damian Lillard was assessed a technical while arguing with a referee heading into the locker room at halftime.\u00a0After that, however, the New Orleans run continued, and by the end of the quarter they had scored 41 points in 12 minutes to open a 24 point lead, the largest by either team in the game. Both teams committed sloppy turnovers and bad passes, but only New Orleans seemed able to capitalize on them. \"In the third quarter we missed some shots that gave them momentum,\" said Head Coach Terry Stotts, \"But we had 65 points in the half, I\u2019ll take that all night.\" The Blazers only made 3 threes in the entire second half, as New Orleans\u2019 lead eventually ballooned to 26. Portland\u2019s starters exited the game before the quarter was halfway through, and fans in the arena headed for the exits when Williamson checked out of the game with 6:23 left in the fourth. \"We just didn't have enough energy,\" said Damian Lillard, who scored 20 points, but missed all four of his shot attempts from beyond the arc. In the last meeting between the teams, Portland shot 4-29 (13.8%) from three. Tonight, they shot 7-29 (24.1%), their third-worst shooting performance of the season. The last game in New Orleans was also Carmelo Anthony's first game as a Trail Blazer, in which he scored 10 points. Tuesday he had 18 Meanwhile, Williamson had arguably the best game of his NBA career so far, with a career high 31 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. \"He\u2019s dynamic, very explosive, quick jumper, quick reactor. His first step is quick, advanced strength,\" said Blazers Head Coach Terry Stotts, \"he\u2019s a tough matchup.\" \u201cHe's only played like, seven games\" said CJ McCollum, \"people haven't figured out how to stop him yet.\" The loss means Portland falls to 0-3 on the season against the Pelicans with\u00a0little time to refocus, as they face the Memphis Grizzlies tomorrow night in Memphis. It's the last game before All-Star Weekend in Chicago, where Damian Lillard will be competing in the Three-Point Contest on Saturday and the All-Star Game on Sunday. "}

It was the first meeting in a pivotal matchup between the two teams as they jockey for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference heading into the All-Star break. Compounding the disappointment was the fact that Damian Lillard exited the game in the final minutes with a non-contact injury that the team is calling a right groin strain. Lillard will undergo an MRI tomorrow, but said after the game he would sit out this weekend's All-Star Game and Three Point Contest in Chicago. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m playing\u2026 Actually I know it. I knew right away it wasn\u2019t going to happen.\" Lillard said after the game. \"I\u2019ll still be there and be a part of it\u2026 hopefully somebody who should have been there and didn\u2019t make it [can compete], Devin Booker or somebody like that.\u201d Portland's difficult road trip saw them face the #1 pick in last year's draft, Zion Williamson last night in New Orleans, and the #2 pick in Ja Morant this evening in Memphis. Morant seemed to have the offense in the palm of his hand, finding players cutting backdoor multiple times in the first half. Portland found their points on fast breaks early on, and seemed to have momentum after a 9-0 run, but Memphis answered with a 10-0 run of their own. The key continued to be wide open for Memphis through the first half, and they dominated in that realm, eventually finishing the game with a 76-34 scoring advantage in the paint. After leading 18-17 in the first, the Blazers never led again in the game. \"Memphis played really well and with high energy. They were well rested,\" said Terry Stotts, \"They had a lot of energy in transition, had a lot of paint points. They're a good paint team anyways.\" The Trail Blazers continued to make the game interesting behind stellar shooting from Anfernee Simons off the bench, who finished with 22 points on 7-12 shooting, but they never came closer than when they narrowed the score to 82-86 with 1:26 left in the third. The Grizzlies then went on an 8-0 run that effectively put the game away. Damian Lillard scored 20 points to go with 10 assists, his 16th double-double of the season, a career high. Hassan Whiteside finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds, but was ejected from the game in the closing seconds after picking up his second technical when he got into an altercation with Jonas Valanciunas under the rim. \u201cWe gotta take advantage of this break, rest mentally and physically, escape, and come back ready,\" said CJ McCollum in the locker room after the game. The Blazers next game is February 21st against the New Orleans Pelicans in Portland. "}

Given how accurate both teams have been behind there arc this season, it's not surprising to see how many attempts they got up Sunday night. Both the Trail Blazers and Heat took nearly half of their attempts from behind the three-point line, though Miami couldn't find the mark when it mattered the most, with Portland coming away with a 115-109 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 19,726 Sunday night at the Moda Center. \u201cI think we\u2019re playing good basketball, I think we\u2019re playing tough,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"Miami is a difficult team to play against because of their style. I just liked our toughness more than anything else, both mental and physical toughness to win a game.\" The Trail Blazers are now 25-29 overall and 15-11 at home this season. The Blazers have now won five straight games at home, a season best, and are 7-3 over their last 10 games. The win also ends a three-game losing streak to the Heat. While the three-point shot is more prevalent and important today that it has been at any point during NBA history, the Trail Blazers and Heat still took their willingness to shoot from range to new levels Sunday night. The two teams combined to shoot 91 three-pointers, with the Trail Blazers going 19-of-42 and the Heat shooting 20-of-49. Considering those percentages, it's hard to imagine that either coach had an issue with the number of threes attempted. And at least in Portland's case, it was welcomed. \"I feel great about that,\" said Stotts. \"If we can get good looks from three, we have a lot of great three-point shooters... That's kind of the way the league is going. I do think we have a good paint presence. Damian's penetration and Hassan's paint presence opens up the opportunities for threes.\" And the Blazers have shown themselves more than willing to take those opportunities. Trevor Ariza got up four three-pointers, with three of those coming in the first quarter. CJ McCollum got up nine attempts from deep, making three. Gary Trent Jr. continued his strong play, with five of his eight made field goals coming from deep. And considering how shorthanded the Trail Blazers currently are -- they played most of Sunday's game with seven players with Anfernee Simons (concussion) and Nassir Little (left ankle sprain) sitting out and Mario Hezonja leaving the game after five minutes with a left ankle sprain -- relying on threes is probably a wise approach. \"The teams that shoot a lot of threes are really good at getting them so (Miami) just happened to get a lot of threes up,\" said Lillard, who went 6-of-15 from the three-point line. \"Our coaches have been on us a year and a half now like \"We need to shoot more threes.' Tonight was a night where we was firing them.\" Portland went 6-of-11 from three in the third quarter, with a number of those makes coming during a 12-2 run that gave the Trail Blazers a 79-67 lead with 6:31 to play in the quarter. The Blazers would outscore the Heat 30-23 in the quarter, thanks mostly to Miami going just 2-of-6 from three in the quarter, giving the Blazers their first real separation of the game and a 10-point lead going into the fourth. Though the Heat would use the three to cut into there Blazers' advantage early in the fourth. Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder and Goran Dragic would all net three-pointers in the firs six and a half minutes of the quarter, cutting Portland's lead to 99-97 after a Dragic 25-footer. But on the next possession, Trent Jr. answered with a three of his own to pus the advantage back to five with just over five minutes to play. Lillard finished a three the old fashioned way to push the lead to eight, with Crowder responding with another three to drop the deficit back to five. After two Ariza free throws, Dragic made another three to cut Portland's lead to 107-103. Trent Jr. came back with another three on the next possession, and then Dragic came through again to bring the score to 111-0106 with 1:13 to play. But Miami's three-point run would ultimately come up short. Down five with 25.6 seconds to play, Robinson missed twice and Dragic once from three, all on the same possession, to end Miami's chance of sweeping the season series. Hassan Whiteside was finally able to corral the rebound and was fouled, making two free throws against his former team to seal the six-point victory for Portland. Damian Lillard lead all scorers with 33 points on 11-of-23 shooting, eight assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block in 37 minutes. It was his 25th game this season with at least 30 points and his 19th straight game of scoring at least 20 points, tying the longest streak of his career. Trevor Ariza scored 15 of his 21 points in the first quarter while also tallying five assists, four rebounds and three steals in just under 40 minutes. Carmelo Anthony added 15 points and six rebounds and CJ McCollum added 13 points in 39 minutes. Hassan Whiteside put his his 39th double-double of the season with 11 points and 17 rebounds. And Gary Trent Jr. finished with 22 points, the only points scored off Portland's bench Sunday night. Five Heat players finished in double figures led by 27 points from Goran Dragic. Duncan Robinson finished with 19 and Jae Crowder went for 18 points and 11 rebounds. \u2022 Portland shot 19-of-42 (45.2%) from 3-PT range, while Miami was 20-of-49 (40.8%)from deep. It was the 10th time in Trail Blazers history that Portland made at least 19threes, while the Heat made 20-plus threes for the third time in team history. \u2022 The Trail Blazers recorded nine steals and six blocks to the Heat\u2019s six steals and five blocks. \u2022 Portland was 40-of-85 (47.1%) from the field, while Miami shot 39-of-98 (39.8%). It was the eighth time in the last nine games that Portland has shot at least 45% from the field. \u2022 Six Trail Blazers scored in double figures for the 12th time this season. Every player who scored for Portland finished in double figures. \u2022 Miami outscored Portland in transition, 20-18. \"I told him the other day \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever been more proud or happier for another player or a younger player since I\u2019ve been in the league than I am of what he\u2019s been doing.\" -- Damian Lillard on the recent play of Gary Trent Jr. The Trail Blazers now hit the road for a back-to-back versus the Pelicans and Grizzlies before the start of the All-Star Break.

The Trail Blazers fell 117-114 to the Jazz in an affair that was contentious from start to finish and was ultimately marred by a missed goaltending call in the final moments of regulation. \u201cI was really proud of our guys,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"I mean obviously we\u2019re short-handed and it was an outstanding effort by everyone who played. And it\u2019s just a shame that it was decided on an inexcusable missed call. There\u2019s no other way to describe it. They could have called goaltending and reviewed it. But they swallowed their whistles on a play that was pretty obvious. So it\u2019s disappointing that such great effort was decided by that.\" The Trail Blazers are now 24-29 overall and 10-18 on the road this season. With the win, the Jazz lead the season series 2-1 with one game left to play in Portland. The Blazers are currently ninth in the Western Conference, 1.5 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the eighth and final playoff spot. Friday's game was always going to be a difficult one for the Trail Blazers. With starting center Hassan Whiteside ruled out before the game with a lower leg contusion, Nassir Little not with the team due to a sprained left ankle and Rodney Hood, Zach Collins and Jusuf Nurkic all continuing their injury rehabilitation, Portland had just nine players in uniform. But it wouldn't stay that way. Anfernee Simons was undercut by Utah forward Royce O'Neale on a jumpshot attempt, resulting in Simons smelling the back of his head on the court. After spending a few minutes on the deck, Simons left the court under his own power, though he was later diagnosed with a contusion and did not return, leaving Portland with eight players. And then there were seven after Trevor Ariza was ejected after being called for double technical fouls for charging and yelling at a referee after a non-call with over 10 minutes to play in the second quarter. But despite being down to just seven players for nearly three-fourths of the game, the Blazers held the lead and went up by as many as 16 points in the third quarter. But fatigue -- not only were the Blazers down to seven men, they were also playing at elevation on the second night of a back-to-back -- and frustration with the officiating started to catch up with the visitors by the midway point of the third quarter. The Jazz held the Trail Blazers to 28 percent shooting from the field and just 1-of-8 shooting from three to outscore the visitors 39-17 in the third, giving Portland just a one-point lead going into the fourth. From there, it seemed as though Utah might pull away in the fourth, but despite many excuses, Portland never relented. Damian Lillard seemingly willed himself to the rim and made two three-pointers, both of which came with a high degree of difficulty. CJ McCollum made two three-pointers as well and Gary Trent Jr. played dogged defense. So rather than fold up, Portland overcame a seven-point Utah lead with just over three minutes to play to tie the game at 112-112 after Lillard's second three-pointer with 1:17 to play in regulation. \u201cI love the way we played,\" said Lillard. \"We were on a back-to-back against a team that plays really well at home and we came out and did what we were supposed to do. We had a great first half, they made their run, got back into the game and we weathered the storm and we gave ourselves a chance to win a tough game on the road.\" After trading baskets, Donovan Mitchell gave the Jazz the lead on a driving layup with 19.5 to play. On the ensuing possession, Lillard drove and drew contact from O'Neale before placing the ball off the glass. But Jazz center Rudy Gobert slapped the ball away after it touch the glass, which constitutes an obvious goaltend, though none of the three referees made the call. And since no call was made, there was no review triggered, resulting in the Jazz getting the ball and ultimately the victory. \"I'm telling (the referees) they're grabbing and bumping the whole game, that's fine,\" said an infuriated Lillard post-game. \"We get to the last play of the game and they miss an easy call. And then they tell us 'It's an easy no-call,' that was obviously not a goaltend. It cost us a (expletive) game. Cost us a game.\" As multiple players noted, it's not uncommon, or even unexpected, for officials to miss calls. But the seemingly obvious nature of the missed goaltend call Friday night, along with the fact the Trail Blazers are fighting for their playoff lives, left everyone in Portland's locker room as angry as many who have covered the team for years have ever seen them. \"It's an easy call,\" said Lillard. \"Three referees out there and they don't call that. And I don't want to see no report about 'oh, we should have called it' or none of that. They cost us the game. We in a playoff race and they cost us a game, on an easy call.\" With Utah corralling the rebound, Portland had to foul, sending Bojan Bogdaanovic to the line, where he went one of two. Portland had once last chance to send the game to overtime, but Caleb Swanigan's three from the corner was well off, giving the Jazz the three-point victory. Lillard led all scorers with 42 points on 16-of-30 shooting from the field, 8-of-14 shooting from three and 2-of-3 shooting from the free throw line. Lillard also finished with six assists, six rebounds, two blocks and a steal in 43 minutes. CJ McCollum shot 10-of-23 from the field and 50 percent from three to finish with 27 points, five rebounds and three assists in 42 minutes. Gary Trent Jr. added 16 points an d Mario Hezonja did yeoman's work to the tune of 11 points, six rebounds, three steals and an assist in 26 minutes. Six Jazz players scored in double figures led bye 27 points from Bojan Bogdanovic. Mike Conley went for 18 points while Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, both of whom will play in the 2020 All-Star Game, both finished with 16 points.

In what is now the new normal for All-Star team selection, the NBA had the top two vote-getters from each conference -- for the second straight year, those honors went to LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- draft their teams Thursday afternoon on TNT rather than simply putting the teams together by conference. The eight players who received the most votes from fans, players and media earn the right to start the All-Star Game and are selected first in the draft. After that, the draft moves to the reserves, selected by coaches vote, who were announced last Thursday.

It's a considerable improvement in Lillad's All-Star draft stock, as he was the sixth pick of the reserve round last year, and likely would have been first reserved picked this year had Antetokounmpo been forced to select his teammate, Khris Middleton. Lillard joins starters Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic and James Harden and reserves Ben Simmons, Nikola Jokic, Jayson Tatum, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Domantas Sabonis. Antetokounmpo's team consists of starters Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam, Kemba Walker and Trae Young with Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram and Donovan Mitchell making up the reserves. James referenced Lillard's recent historic scoring run, which of course included Dame going for 48 points in a win versus LeBron's Lakers on Jan. 31, while doing the \"Dame Time\" wrist tap while selecting the 6-3 point guard in his eighth season out of Weber State. LeBron also is well aware of how Dame performance in All-Star games after seeing him go for 18 points, five assists, six rebounds and two steals in last year's game, which Team LeBron won 178-165 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte.

All told, it's safe to say that LeBron James is a fan of Damian Lillard, and takes what few opportunities he has to team up with him at every possible juncture. Along with playing for Team LeBron on All-Star Sunday Night, Lillard will participate in the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night, after which he's scheduled to perform on stage under his nom de rap, \"Dame D.O.L.L.A.\" The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled to be held on February 16 at the United Center in Chicago.

After rupturing his left Achilles tendon in a loss to the Lakers at the Moda Center on December 6, the 6-8 forward out of Duke has mostly been out of the public eye, save for a few posting on social media. But nearly two months after undergoing surgery to repair his left Achilles, Hood has become more of a fixture at Trail Blazers games and practices as he continues his rehabilitation. He recently traveled with the team to Los Angeles for a game versus the Lakers, has started to attend home games and has joined fellow injured players for workouts at the team's practice facility in Tualatin. Prior to Sunday night's victory versus the Miami Heat the Moda Center, Hood discussed where he's at in the rehabilitation process, keeping a positive mindset, his daily workout regiment, one of the positives of the injury and his goal of coming back from injury as a better player. So in general, how is the process of getting back on the court going thus far? Rodney Hood: Everything's been going good, it's been going smooth. I'm about seven weeks post-surgery and I'm moving along nicely. I'm in two shoes, doing weight-bearing things, lifting weights and stuff like that. I'm ahead of schedule right now and I'm healing up fast, so we'll see where that takes me. But I'm just taking it day-by-day. Those first days after the injury must be the most difficult part to get through. Rodney Hood: Yeah, there's a lot of things that go through your mind at that time. I was very discouraged at first but I had a lot of positive people around me, a lot of people encouraging me and just reiterated that it was going to be a tough process but there's a lot of people that's with me. Once I got out of surgery, I just had a positive mindset. I've had a positive mindset every single day working towards getting back. That's my only thought that's going through my mind, no negative thoughts on my mind, just trying to get back. It's been good so far. What is a day like for you right now? Is it a full day of rehab? Rodney Hood: I have time off. The first month, I couldn't do anything, I was just laying in bed. Now, I get up around seven, I come in and workout at eight. Some days I do the pool, some days I lift weights, do upper and lower body, getting that strength back. My day is not done at 10 -- I finish that work around 10. Get some breakfast or something like that and then I do a lot of things at home trying to get strength back into my Achilles. I do it every single day. Six days-a-week rehabbing, been around Zach (Collins) which can make the process a little more terrifying, but it's been good so far. With as much time away as you spend practicing and playing, I imagine one small positive of the injury is having the opportunity to spend more time at home. Rodney Hood: That's the best part. This year, being on the road so much it felt like, getting a chance to be with the kids, be with my wife, be here in Portland, being able to think a lot. I think being able to be still has really been a positive for me. Obviously I wish I was out there playing, but I think I'll be a better player once I go back because the game is slowing down for me. I'm able to watch a little bit more and take things from it. I'm looking forward to it. I'm trying my best to be patient but it's been good. Timelines aside, what are your hopes for the next three months? Four months? Going into the beginning of next season? Rodney Hood: I don't really have a timeline, hasn't been discussed, but obviously I want -- I'm going to play next year. I've been healing fast so hopefully I'm ready by training camp. But things happen and things slow up and speed up, you just never know. But I really want to get back as soon as possible so I can help our goal toward a championship next year. I imagine it's important to go into this process knowing that things can change and having setbacks is just a part of it rather than some kind of failure. Rodney Hood: Yeah, it's very unpredictable, it's a long process. Some guys take seven months, some guys take a year, some take more than that. You got to focus on your body, see what makes you feel right. And once I'm right, I'm gonna get out there and play and try my best. I know it's going to be a process to find myself again and everything like that, but I'm ready for it. I'm mentally ready for it. I've been doing everything possible to make sure I'm taking the right steps. It's becoming fun to me. I'm not looking at it like it's a grueling process, it's: What can you get out of it? It's not just rehabbing and being mad at the world, it's about what can you learn from it, what can you take from this type of situation and make it better for you going forward. "}

In the end, the Trail Blazers were able to overcome the differential by taking and making their own shots rather than being gifted free throws by the referees. Portland made nine of their 10 three-point attempts in the fourth quarter to pull away from the Spurs for a 125-117 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 19,653 Thursday night at the Moda Center. The Trail Blazers are now 24-28 overall and 14-11 at home this season. Portland has now won six of their last eight and five of their last six. More importantly, the win gives the Trail Blazers a 2-1 season series victory versus the Spurs, a team tracking just behind Portland in the Western Conference standings. While the Trail Blazers often looked like the better team Thursday night -- they shot better than 50 percent from the field, won the rebounding battle and scored significantly more points in the paint for the first three quarters -- they could not overcome a Spurs team that went to the free throw line with alarming frequency. On the other side, the Blazers shot just one free throw in the first quarter and none in the second. By the time three quarters had been played, the Blazers had been called for 14 fouls to eight for the Spurs. And to make matters much, much worse, San Antonio shot 19 free throws to just 10 for the Trail Blazers through three quarters. The Trail Blazers also turned the ball over 12 times for 10 Spurs points, resulting in the Spurs leading by as many as 10 Thursday night before entering the fourth quarter with an 92-86 advantage. San Antonio's free throw offense continued to work in the fourth, with Derrick White getting more free throws attempts (six) in the quarter than any Trail Blazer got in the entire game. But when it became apparent that they'd never be able to setting the score thanks to the referees, the Trail Blazers looked to their long-range shooting to win the game. Down 94-86, the Blazers went on an 18-6 run, with most of the damage coming from three-pointers from Carmelo Anthony, CJ McCollum and Gary Trent Jr., to take a 104-100 lead with just over eight minutes to play in regulation. It was especially the shooting of Trent Jr. that allowed Portland to secure the win. The second-year guard out Duke went 4-of-4 from three for 12 fourth-quarter points while finishing with 18 for the game. \"Whenever you get out there and make plays, knock down shots, you get in a good groove and feel good about yourself and continue to keep pushing,\" said Trent Jr. who has seen an uptick in minutes lately due to consistent play. \"Getting game reps, you can practice all you want and do all the conditioning in the world, but you can\u2019t simulate a real game. Knowing angles, knowing players tendencies, knowing what they can do helps me out there.\" Behind Trent Jr., Portland shot 64 percent from there field to outscore San Antonio by 14 in the fourth quarter to come away with the eight-point win versus a team right behind the Trail Blazers in the Western Conference playoff race. \"I think we\u2019re past the point of, \u2018Oh it\u2019s just another game\u2019 and kind of shooing it off,\" said Damian Lillard. \"Every game is important but games like this are even more important because they\u2019re one of the teams that we\u2019re fighting for that spot with. It was a tie breaker game. We\u2019re not playing them no more after this. And it also just gives us some separation from them.\" Damian Lillard went 9-of-20 from the field, 3-of-9 from three and 5-of-5 from the free throw line for 26 points to go with 10 assists for his 15th double-double of the season. Hassan Whiteside continued his strong play on both ends, going 8-of-10 from the field for 17 points to go with 23 rebounds and four blocks in 36 minutes. Carmelo Anthony scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half while also grabbing eight rebounds. CJ McCollum, despite battling foul trouble for most of the night, added 19 points, six assists and three rebounds in 30 minutes. Gary Trent Jr. finished with 18 points on 6-of-7 shooting while matching his season high with four assists. Anfernee Simons rounded out Portland's double-digit scorers with 10 points in 15 minutes. Trey Lyles led the Spurs with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the double-double. Lamarcus Aldridge finished with 20 points and DeMar DeRozan had 21 on 6-of-16 shooting. \u2022 The Trail Blazers won their fourth straight game at Moda Center, matching their longest winning streak at home this season (four, 12/10/19 \u2013 12/21/19). \u2022 Portland shot 18-of-37 from the three-point line (48.6%) while the Spurs shot 10-of-28(35.7%). The Trail Blazers made nine three-pointers in the fourth quarter on 10 attempts. \u2022 The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Spurs, 50-39. \u2022 Portland scored 120-plus points for the seventh time in its last eight games. The TrailBlazers are now 14-4 when they score at least 120 points. \u2022 The Trail Blazers outscored the Spurs in the paint, 48-44. \u2022 San Antonio made 25 free throws (of 28, 89.3%) while the Trail Blazers made nine free throws (of 12, 75.0%). \"He\u2019s the best shot blocker I\u2019ve ever been around. I feel like he\u2019s going to block everything.\" -- Damian Lillard on Hassan Whiteside After hosting the Spurs Thursday night, the Trail Blazers head to Salt Lake City to face the Utah Jazz in the second game of a back-to-back.

Portland had a four-game winning streak snapped while Lillard finished with \"just\" 21 points in a 127-99 loss to the Denver Nuggets in front of an announced sellout of 19,520 Tuesday night at the Pepsi Center. The Trail Blazers are now 23-28 overall and 10-17 on the road this season. Denver has secured the season series versus Portland by winning three of the first four meetings. The start of Tuesday night's game didn't really portend a blowout, though it wasn't exactly smooth sailing for the Trail Blazers, either. But with Lillard scoring 11 points and the team as a whole shooting a respectable 43 percent from the field, Portland went into the second quarter with a manageable 37-28 deficit. But it wouldn't stay manageable for long. After playing their best basketball of the season over the last four games, Portland turned in probably their worst quarter of the season Tuesday in Denver. \"Well, second quarter was rough offensively,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well... Second quarter was a struggle offensively. That being said, defensively, we made a lot of mistakes in the first half, miscommunications on some switches and cuts and they took advantage of it.\" The Trail Blazers scored just 10 points, a season low, on 5-of-25 shooting from the field and 0-of-9 shooting from three. They were out-rebounded by nine, didn't shoot a free throws, were called for a flagrant foul and had just six points on the board with under four minutes to play in the quarter. By the time the quarter mercifully came to an end, Portland was outscored 27-10 and trailed 64-38 at the intermission. \"Just looking back at (the second quarter), I remember a fair amount of really good looks that we got, we just didn't make shots,\" said Lillard. \"I think it was also a little bit of (the Nuggets), the energy and aggressiveness that they had. Score 10 points in the quarter, we never had a great shot.\" An 11-4 run midway through the third quarter gave the Nuggets their largest lead of the game at 90-56, ended what little hope there might have been for a second-half Blazers rally. From there, all that was left to be decided was how much Portland's reserves would play (answer: the entire fourth quarter), whether they would surpass their lowest scoring total this season (answer: they did, by six points) and if the final would be their largest deficit of the season (answer: at 28 points, it tied their worst loss with the New Year's Day loss to the Knicks). \"It's been a while since we had a game like that,\" said CJ McCollum. \"You got to take the good with the bad, move forward and regroup and get ready for San Antonio on Thursday.\" Lillard led the Blazers with 21 points on 8-of-23 shooting, nine assists and two rebounds in 30 minutes. The performance ended a seven-game streak of Lillard scoring at least 34 points and was his lowest point total since scoring 20 versus the Timberwolves on January 9. McCollum finished with 20 points on 8-of-18 shooting. Gary Trent Jr. added 21 and Anfernee Simons finished with 10. Nuggets center Nikola Jokic finished just short of a triple-double with 29 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists in 31 minutes. Jamal Murray tallied 20 points, six assists and Jerami Grant added 17 points and four rebounds in 30 minutes. The Trail Blazers now return home to host the Spurs in an important contest in terms of playoff positioning for both teams. \"Huge game for us,\" said McCollum. \"It's gonna be crucial down the stretch of the season, could decide our fate.\" Tipoff is scheduled for Thursday night at 7 p.m. "}

Forgive us if we\u2019re sounding like a broken record. Saturday night at Moda Center, Portland (23-27) knocked off the fourth-seeded Utah Jazz (32-17) by a count of 124-107 behind a sellout crowd of 19,603. The Trail Blazers have now defeated three of the top five seeds in the West in the last four nights. Portland has won a season-high tying four straight games overall. \u201cI think how we\u2019re competing, how we\u2019re playing together and our energy, the swagger that we\u2019ve got about us \u2013 we\u2019re sustaining it,\u201d Lillard said about the victory. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up quality wins against playoff teams, really good teams. We\u2019ve just got to keep rolling.\u201d What made Saturday\u2019s win all the more impressive was the quick turnaround after Friday\u2019s emotional and hard-fought win against the Lakers, as the team celebrated the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant. \u201cI told the team that\u2019s as good of a back-to-back as you\u2019re gonna get,\u201d said Head Coach Terry Stotts. \u201cTo go to LA, under the circumstances of that game and get a win, and then come back here, get back here at 2:30 in the morning, and beat a good, rested team, that\u2019s a hell of a back-to-back.\u201d This win was once again led by Lillard. Portland\u2019s five-time NBA All-Star tallied 51 points on 17-29 shooting, 9-15 from three-point range and 8-8 from the foul line. He added 12 assists for his fourth straight double-double, the longest streak of his career. Lillard, who seems to re-write a line in the record books every night, became the first player in NBA history to make at least six three-pointers in six straight games. He has scored at least 36 points in each of those six games, averaging an astounding 48.8 points (and 10.2 assists) in that span. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable, I would say. I\u2019m just happy to be a part of it, to be a fan of it,\u201d said Carmelo Anthony, who returned to action after missing Friday\u2019s game against the Lakers. \u201cBeing on the team with him. Being out there to help him in any way I can. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen anything like this.\u201d Lillard now has four 50-point games this season, second-most in the NBA (James Harden, five). He is the 10th player in NBA history with at least four games of 50-plus points in a season. Lillard also extended a franchise record with his eighth consecutive game of 30 points or more. After the Jazz jumped out to a 13-point lead, the Trail Blazers closed the first period on a 12-0 run to bring the game within a point, 34-33, at the quarter break. Portland then took its first lead of the game at 41-39 early in the second period. After Utah regained the lead later in the second, Portland again closed the quarter with a run \u2013 this time 15 straight points to send the Trail Blazers into locker room with a 63-53 advantage. Portland never again trailed in the game, leading by double digits most of the way home. TOP PERFORMERS NOTABLE QUOTABLE \u201cWe\u2019re just finding it.\u00a0 We\u2019re finding a groove. We\u2019re staying the course - I\u2019ve said that since I got here. Just stay the course, it\u2019s a long season, ups and downs, things that happen. Of course Dame is leading us and we\u2019re fine with his leading. Guys are just doing what they have to do to help this team win.\u201d - Carmelo Anthony HIGHLIGHTS  NEXT UP The Trail Blazers get Super Bowl Sunday and an additional day on Monday to recuperate after a long back-to-back before returning to action in Denver on Tuesday. The opening tip from Pepsi Center is scheduled for 6 p.m. PT on Rip City Radio 620 AM and NBC Sports Northwest, which will feature a special broadcast with commercial-free quarters. "}

This year, it simply wound't be an All-Star Game without him. After coming in third, one spot below the cut line, among West guards in All-Star starters voting, Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard was selected via coaches vote as a reserve for the 2020 All-Star Game, scheduled for Sunday, February 16 at the United Center in Chicago. Lillard is joined by Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell and Brandon Ingram as West reserves. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo and Domantas Sabonis comprise the East reserve team. It is Lillard's third consecutive All-Star Game selection and his fifth selection overall, putting him behind only Clyde Drexler (eight) for the most in franchise history. The 6-3 point guard in his eighth season out of Weber State is averaging 29.0 points, good for fourth in the NBA, on 46 percent shooting from the field and 39 percent shooting from three, 7.8 assists, which ranks sixth, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 37.1 minutes per game this season. He's also second in the league this season in made three-pointers and made free throws. But it's his play over the last two weeks of the that ended any lingering doubt, if such doubt even existed, about whether Lillard would be one of the seven Western Conference players voted in by the coaches for the 2020 event. The question this season hasn't been whether he should be an all-star, but rather, how could be not be? He became the first player in franchise history to score at least 30 points in six consecutive games and was recently named Western Conference Player of the Week by averaging 52.7 points on 53 percent shooting from the field and 57 percent shooting from three, 7.3 rebounds and 9.3 assists. He set a new career high of 61 points, which is also the high mark this season in the NBA, in a win versus the Warriors, is the only player in the league to score at least 50 points twice this season and with 36 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, completed the first triple-double of his career in Wednesday's victory versus the Rockets at the Moda Center. Simply put, Lillard has arguably been the best player in the NBA since the start of the New Year, and he wasn't too shabby to start the 2019-20 season either. While the Trail Blazers have had a better record at this point in the season on numerous occasions during Lillard's career, his individual play has never been better. There's no debate: Damian Lillard is an All-Star. With all of the starters and reserves selected, we now have to wait until Thursday, February 6 to find out which whether Lillard will be drafted by LeBron James -- as was the case in last year -- or Giannis Antetokounmpo for their respective teams.

Those are games you still need to get, but those wins don't exactly inspire confidence that the tide is about to turn. But after arguably having less than four \"good wins\" all season, the Trail Blazers secured four \"good wins\" in the last week alone, besting the Pacers, Rockets, Lakers and Jazz thanks in large part to never-before-seen performances from Damian Lillard, who won Western Conference Player of the Week in back-to-back weeks. But the play of Hassan Whiteside, the addition of Trevor Ariza and the improvement of the bench has also seemed to have shaken the Trail Blazers out of a season-long funk. So not only have the Trail Blazers moved up the standings -- they're 1.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the eight-seed with 32 games to play -- they've also received a bounce in the weekly power rankings. Observe... \u2022 The panel of voters at ESPN have the Trail Blazers at No. 15 this week, four spots better than last week... Beginning with his career-high 61 points on Jan. 20, Damian Lillard's past six games look like this: 61, 47, 50, 36, 48, 51. With 61 assists. Lillard isn't on another planet right now; he's in another galaxy. Nobody cooks like Lillard. You have to pick him up somewhere between the parking garage and the locker room, or he'll pop you for a 37-footer. But even more than the ridiculous raw numbers, Portland's record in the past six games looks like this: WLWWWW. Lillard is doing what it takes to get his team back in the postseason conversation, as the Blazers are now just 1.5 games back of the 8-seed. The folks at ESPN have the Trail Blazers behind the Grizzlies at No. 14 and ahead of the Spurs at No. 16. \u2022 John Shuhmann at NBA.com also has the Trail Blazers at No. 15 this week, a three-spot improvement over last week... Pace: 101.3 (11) OffRtg: 111.7 (7) DefRtg: 112.7 (26) NetRtg: -1.1 (16) Damian Lillard has had a six-game stretch like we've never seen before, even admitting, \"I've never been in this type of rhythm in my life.\" Really, he was draining 3-pointers over Rudy Gobert standing on the 3-point line like the two-time Defensive Player of the Year was 6-1 instead of 7-1. Over the last two weeks (it's safe to assume that a second straight Player of the Week award is coming), Lillard has averaged 48.8 points, shooting 52% inside the arc, 57% from beyond it, and 92% at the free throw line. Also... 1. The Blazers have gone 4-1 against teams with winning records over the two weeks, having won just five games over the 13 teams that have winning records prior to that. 2. Three of the last four opponents have top-10 defenses, and the Blazers have scored 128 points per 100 possessions over those three games. 3. Over the two weeks, the Blazers have climbed from 14th to seventh in offensive efficiency and from 11th to ninth place in the Western Conference. They still have all three meetings with the eighth-place Grizzlies (Lillard vs. Morant feels like a must-see match) remaining. But before they get to the first one (next Wednesday), the Blazers have three more meetings with good teams and a big game against the 10th-place Spurs. Schuhmann has the Trail Blazers behind the Grizzlies at No. 14 and ahead of the Spurs at No. 16. \u2022 Colin Ward-Henninge at CBS Sports has the Trail Blazers at No. 14 this week, a six-spot improvement over last week... There are simply no adjectives to describe what Damian Lillard is doing right now. Over his last six games he's averaging 48.8(!) points, 10.2 assists, and 7.2 rebounds. He's also made over eight 3-pointers per game over that stretch on a ridiculous 57 percent shooting from beyond the arc -- many of them WAY beyond the arc. Most importantly, the Blazers have won five of those six games and are suddenly just a game and a half back of the final Western Conference playoff spot. In case anyone had forgotten, Lillard is proving once again that he is a special, special player. Ward-Henninge has the Trail Blazers behind the Thunder at No. 13 and ahead of the Grizzlies at No. 15. \u2022 Tommy Beer at Rotoworld joins the list of power rankers that have the Trail Blazers at No. 15 this week, four spots better than last week... Hmmm, which Blazer should we highlight here? Over the Blazers' last six games, Damian Lillard is averaging a mind-boggling 48.8 points, 10.2 assists, 7.2 rebounds and 8.2 made 3-pointers while shooting 55% from the floor, 57% from downtown and 92% from the free-throw stripe. Beer has the Trail Blazers behind the Grizzlies at No. 14 and ahead of the Spurs at No. 16. \u2022 Zach Harper at The Athletic has the Trail Blazers at No. 14, five spots better than last week... Lillard has 47 points or more in five of his last six games. The one game he didn\u2019t hit that mark? He only scored 36 points. During this six-game stretch Dame has averaged 48.8 points, 10.2 assists, 7.2 rebounds and only 3.0 turnovers. He\u2019s taking 28.0 shots per game and has a true shooting of 74.5 percent. Most important? Lillard\u2019s production has resulted in five victories in six games. Not too long ago, I wrote in this space that Lillard\u2019s production was being wasted because he didn\u2019t have enough help this season. Now? The Blazers are 1.5 games out of the eighth seed in the West and Dame is moving his way into MVP voting, even with a losing record so far. Harper has the Trail Blazers behind the Pacers at No. 13 and in front of the Pelicans at No. 15. \u2022 Phil Watson at Hoops Habit has the Trail Blazers at No. 19 this week, two spots better than last week... Don\u2019t look now, but here come the Portland Trail Blazers and their patented middle-of-the-season run. The Blazers have won four straight games after a 4-0 week, matching their longest run of the season. But while the first win streak came against the Suns, Warriors, Magic and Timberwolves, this one included Indiana, Houston, the Lakers and Utah. Yeah. That\u2019s pretty good. As for Damian Lillard, Dame Dolla has been nothing but a cheat code over the last couple of weeks. In four games last week, his first career triple-double against the Rockets on Wednesday counted as his off night because he only scored 36 points \u2026 only 36 points. He averaged a Wilt Chamberlain-esque 46.3 points per game over the four games, also getting 11.5 assists, 6.8 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 38.6 minutes a night. He shot 57.3 percent overall and a ridiculous, ludicrous, are-you-kidding-me 58.8 percent on 12.8 3-point attempts a game. Watson has the Trail Blazers behind the Nets at No. 18 and ahead of the Grizzlies at No. 20. \u2022 Michael Shapiro at Sports Illustrated has the Trail Blazers at No. 14 this week, one spot better than last week... Has Damian Lillard\u2019s hot stretch changed Portland\u2019s deadline thinking? What was previously a lost year has become a furious fight for a playoff spot, and the Blazers still need an upgrade at the four. Kevin Love feels like a pipe dream. Danilo Gallinari would be a terrific fit. Shapiro has the Trail Blazers behind the Thunder at No. 13 and ahead of the Grizzlies at No. 15. \u2022 Grant Hughes at Bleacher Report has the Trail Blazers at No. 16 this week, three spots better than last week... Damian Lillard \"only\" managed 36 points in Portland's 125-112 win over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, a slow night for a guy whose previous three scoring totals were 61, 47 and 50. But the meager 36 points came in Dame's first career triple-double, so nobody will accuse him of slacking. Things got back to normal when he scored 48 points in the Blazers' 127-119 win over the Los Angeles Lakers in L.A. on Friday. Then, he put up 51 more to beat the Jazz on Saturday. Add all that up and Lillard averaged 48.8 points and 10.2 assists over a six-game span. That's not something that happens. Like, ever. Hughes has the Trail Blazers behind the Pelicans at No. 15 and ahead of the Spurs at No. 17. "}

But on the rare occasions this season when Portland's offense has clicked, it's a stark reminder of just how good they can be when everything falls into place. And Wednesday night's game versus the Rockets, and specifically the second quarter, was one of those occasions. After a mistake-filled start to the game, the Trail Blazers used a 17-3 run in the second quarter and got a triple-double from Damian Lillard, the first of his career, on the way to a 125-112 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 19,393 Wednesday night at the Moda Center. \u201cI was really proud of the way we played, especially after the poor start,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"That first three minutes was a rough three minutes, but we bounced back, and I thought we played good offense throughout the night, we made our runs with aggressive defense, creating some turnovers, getting out in transition. The Trail Blazers are now 21-27 overall and 12-11 at home this season. With the win, the Blazers now own a 2-1 series lead versus the Rockets and finish a four-game homestead with a 3-1 record. The first few minutes of Wednesday's game did not give one the impression that both teams would easily surpass the 100-point mark. That was especially true for the home side, with the Trail Blazers going 1-of-8 from the field to start the game while turning the ball over four times in the first four minutes. But with Lillard scoring 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting from the field and 3-of-4 shooting from three, the Blazers managed to get their accuracy from the field up to 48 percent before the end of the quarter. Where it not for his early-game scoring, the Rockets would have gone into the second quarter leading by far more than six, especially considering they shot 60 percent from the field and 50 percent from three. While Lillard handled the heavy lifting in the first quarter, the rest of the team started to shoulder the load in the second. After trading baskets for the first half of the quarter, Portland went on a 17-3 run to turn a three-point deficit into a 63-51 lead with 2:15 to play in the first half, with Nassir Little, Gary Trent Jr. and Trevor Ariza all playing important roles in the rally. \u201cTrevor\u2019s been in the league a long time,\" said Stotts. \"He knows his niche, he knows how to play, he makes open shots, he defends, he gets out in transitions, he finishes when he has opportunities around the basket, he just knows his role and he knows how to do it well.\" Portland eventually outscored Houston 41-24 in the second quarter to take a 71-60 lead into the intermission. The Blazers kept it up in the third quarter, shooting 55 percent form there field and 50 percent from three while holding James Harden to 1-of-6 shooting. Portland led by as many as 19 points in the third quarter before taking a 97-82 advantage into the fourth. And while the Rockets certainly didn't lay down, most of the suspense in the fourth had to do with whether Lillard, who entered the quarter with 30 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, would finally get the first triple-double of his career. It damn near didn't happen. Lillard, despite having well over four minutes of time to secure his 10th rebound, mostly refused to crash the the glass to complete there statistical accomplishment. He eventually completed his first triple-double by trying to tip in a missed CJ McCollum 10-footer with 57.3 seconds left in regulation. \"It\u2019s about time, it took eight years,\" said Lillard. \"I think it\u2019s been plenty of times where I could have just kind of hunted it \u2013 I\u2019ve been two rebounds or one assist away, but it\u2019s just something about I never wanted to go out there and just chase it. Just growing up, my dad would just always be on my case about playing the game the right way and letting it play out how it\u2019s supposed to play out. So that\u2019s kind of been my approach with the triple-doubles.\" Damian Lillard finished the game with 36 points on 11-of-21 shooting, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his first triple-double. And with the performance, he became the first player in franchise history to score at least 30 points in six straight games. CJ McCollum finished with 22 points, five rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks in 38 minutes. Trevor Ariza, playing in just his third game as a Blazer, went 9-of-14 from the field for a season-high 21 points. Hassan Whiteside put up another double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds while also blocking five shots. Both Gary Trent Jr. and Nassir Little finished with 10 points off the bench. Carmelo Anthony (26,073 career points) passed Kevin Garnett (26,071 career points) for 17th on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. He finished with six points (2-11 FG, 2-2 FT), 13 rebounds, five assists and one steal. The Rockets were led by Russell Westbrook, who finished with a game-high 39 points to go with 10 rebounds and nine assists in 41 minutes. James Harden added 18 points on 18 shots. \u2022 Portland shot above 50% from the field for the third straight contest. The Trail Blazers were 46-of-89 (51.7%) from the field while the Rockets shot 40-of-94 (42.6%). \u2022 Portland outrebounded Houston 50-39, recording 50-plus rebounds for the 11th time this season. \u2022 The Trail Blazers outscored the Rockets in the paint, 50-42. \u2022 Portland scored at least 125 points for the fourth straight game. \u2022 The Trail Blazers had six players score in double figures for the 10th time this season. \u2022 Portland handed out 24 assists to Houston\u2019s 21. \u201cI mean, not really. It was my first career triple double, it didn\u2019t really matter who it was against.\" -- Lillard on if it meant more to get his first triple-double against Russell Westbrook, one of the NBA's all-time leaders in triple-doubles. With the homestead now over, the Trail Blazers head to Los Angeles to face the Lakers in their first game since the untimely death of Kobe Bryant. Tipoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. "}

For the week, Lillard averaged 52.7 points (53.4% FG, 57.4% 3-PT, 94.9% FT), 7.3 rebounds and 9.3 assists while guiding the Trail Blazers to a 2-1 record. During the week, Lillard became the first player in Trail Blazers history to score 40-plus points in three consecutive games and became the second player in league history to make at least eight three-pointers in three consecutive games. Lillard started the week by scoring a franchise-record 61 points (17-37 FG, 11-20 3-PT, 16-16 FT) to go with 10 rebounds, seven assists and one steal in an overtime victory over Golden State on Jan. 20. His 61 points are the most points scored in an NBA game this season while his 11 three-pointers were also a franchise record. In a loss to Dallas on Jan. 23, Lillard recorded 47 points (16-28 FG, 8-15 3-PT, 7-7 FT), six rebounds, eight assists and one steal. It was his 25th career game with 40-plus points.

But while he's always had a strong resume to be included in the midseason exhibition, he hasn't always gotten the votes from the NBA head coaches who select the seven All-Star reserves for each team. So to keep track of Lillard's chances, we here at Trailblazers.com have put together a roundup of All-Star reserve predictions. And while the media making picks have no say regarding All-Star reserves -- media vote does comprise 25 percent of the vote for ALl-Star starters -- the journalists and analysts who cover the league tend to have a good read on who is going to make the cut and who is going to be left out. But considering where Lillard is at in his career, this will likely be the last All-Star prediction roundup we'll bother putting together, as his candidacy over the course of his career has gone from borderline to debatable to secure and finally to where he is now, a lock. He was close to that level last season, but until you get in easily, you can't assume you're going to get in easily. This season, that's a rather safe assumption. Averaging 28.8 points on 46 percent shooting from the field and 38 percent shooting from three, 7.7 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 45 games this season, Lillard has secured his status as one of the preeminent guards in the NBA. And while the Trail Blazers 20-27 record might have hurt Lillard's All-Star chances in previous season, the strength of his individual numbers and the fact that Portland could very easily have one of the worst records in there league if not for his efforts more than makes up for the win/loss record, at least in terms of his All-Star candidacy. So it's no surprise to see every prediction post about 2020 All-Star reserves has Lillard making the cut, and easily. The official announcement happens Thursday at 4 p.m. on TNT. \u2022 ESPN's Zach Lowe has Lillard, along with Nikola Jokic and Rudy Gobert, as a Western reserve \"lock\" in his prediction post. Evidently was enough of a \"this goes without saying\" choice that Lowe... didn't say anything else other than Lillard is a lock. \u2022 The Athletic's John Hollinger has Damian Lillard as one of his two backcourt All-Star reservers in the West... There are many reasons the Blazers have struggled this year. Lillard is most assuredly not one of them. Reminding everyone of his offensive explosiveness by hanging 61 on Golden State to cap off MLK night, Lillard\u2019s season to date fits in almost perfectly with every other season in his esteemed career. In fact, he\u2019s set to post career highs in points, assists and PER. The Blazers, as rough as their season has been, have slightly outscored opponents with Lillard on the court. It\u2019s the other 12 minutes that have been the problem. So, it should be a pretty basic choice here. It\u2019s the same Lillard with worse players around him; that shouldn\u2019t change his automatic status on the West All-Star team. \u2022 TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" crew of Shaq, Chuck, Kenny and Ernie all have Dame making the All-Star Game, which is noteworthy considering these are the same guys who thought Lou Williams (WHO IS GREAT IN HIS OWN RIGHT) should get in over Lillard. \u2022 The Ringer's Dan Devine has Lillard making the West reserve team easily... The Blazers are as close to the playoffs as they are\u2014within just 2.5 games of eighth-place Memphis, only a half-game behind San Antonio for ninth\u2014almost exclusively because Lillard has followed up consecutive top-six MVP finishes with his best season to date. He\u2019s averaging 28.8 points and 7.7 assists per game, both career highs. He\u2019s firing 3s and getting to the foul line more often than ever, and finishing inside the arc more accurately than ever, leading to the highest true shooting percentage of his career. Last week, he became only the eighth player ever to score at least 150 points in a three-game span, ripping off 61-10-7 against the Warriors, 47-6-8 against the Mavericks, and 50-6-13 against the Pacers. Portland has needed everything Lillard has to offer just to stay in the fight this season. He keeps giving it. \u2022 Brian Botkin at CBS Sports has Lillard as his first West reserve... Portland is having a pretty disastrous season, but Lillard is doing his normal thing -- he's eighth in scoring and seventh in assists entering play on Tuesday. The days of Lillard being an on-the-fence All-Star are over. He's in. \u2022 Bleacher Report's Andy Bailey has Lillard as one of three reserve guard picks in the West... Damian Lillard is having the kind of season many expected from Stephen Curry. With Kevin Durant gone and Klay Thompson out, Curry was going to get his shot at the kind of heavy-usage campaign James Harden gets every year in Houston. Of course, a broken hand shelved any chance at that for Curry. Lillard is giving us the fireworks instead. He already has two 60-point performances this season. His 8.1 offensive box plus/minus is pushing toward top-30 status all-time. He's averaging a career-high 27.9 points. And he's on pace for nearly 300 threes. "}

We devote the first portion of the show to discussing the life of Bryant, who both tormented and ultimately gained the respect of many Trail Blazers fans throughout his 20-year career with the Lakers, his status among NBA players, reactions of current and former Trail Blazers to the news of Bryant's passing and the difficulties of playing in or covering a game just hours after a tragedy. We then move on to Damian Lillard's ridiculous offensive production over the last few weeks -- Lillard was named Western Conference Player of rthe Week moments before we finished recording -- the prospect of Trevor Ariza being a better addition than we might have initially assumed and\u00a0 updates on Jusuf Nurki\u0107 and the rest of the injured Trail Blazers.

Lillard, like many of his peers, was unsure how he could play just hours after losing an idol, peer and friend. \"I don't even know how we supposed to play this game tonight,\" said Lillard prior to Sunday's game. \"It's just one of those things that makes you sick to your stomach.\" But Lillard was able to fight through the emotions to put up another 50-point performance in Portland's 139-129 victory versus the Pacers in front of a sellout crowd of 19,663 Sunday night at the Moda Center. \"I wouldn't say I used it or put it behind me, I just kind of played the game,\" said Lillard. \"Once the game started, fouls started getting called, teams making shots, it kind of just turned into like a game. It was almost like an escape. Just in those moments where you're sitting on the bench, longer timeout, just sitting there randomly it came into my mind a few times. I was like 'Man, that really happened.' I think that was it, just played the game, tried to get lost into the game.\" The Trail Blazers are now 20-27 overall and 11-11 at home this season. Portland has now won 11 straight games at home versus the Pacers and the last five regardless of location. The game started with the Trail Blazers honoring Bryant, who wore No. 24, by purposefully taking a 24-second violation. On the next possession, the Pacers took an eight-second violation, an homage to the number Bryant first wore when he entered the NBA. \u201cIt was just a way of honoring him,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"I can\u2019t say we knew it was coming, I thought it was a great gesture. I think it started with San Antonio and Toronto, and then other teams around the league did it, I thought it was a great gesture for a great player in this league.\" After honoring Bryant, both teams turned their attention as best they could to the task at hand. And no one on the court managed to emulate Bryant better than Lillard, who went 4-of-4 from the field, 2-of-2 from three and 7-of-8 from the free throw line to score 17 points in the first 12 minutes. With Lillard continuing a hot streak the likes of which have never been seen in Portland, the Blazers took a nine-point lead into the second quarter, and after outscoring the Pacers by one in the second, took a 10-point advantage into the intermission. The remainder of the game basically consisted of the Pacers going on runs to get the score to the high single digits only to have Lillard, CJ McCollum or Carmelo Anthony hitting a three or sparking a mini-run to push the lead back to a comfortable margin. While there were brief moments of trepidation in the fourth quarter, shooting 70 percent from the field while making eight of 12 three-point attempts in the third quarter to go up by as many as 21 points. \u201cI was really pleased with how we played,\" said Stotts. \"Third quarter basketball was probably our best offensive quarter of the season, the ball was moving, sharing the ball, made shots, it was a lot of fun to watch, hopefully that\u2019s something we can build on.\" Lillard still had a bit more work to do, scoring 14 points in the fourth to reach the 50-point mark while ensuring the Pacers, who cut the lead down to seven with 5:28 to play in the game, wouldn't ruin another historic performance from the 6-3 point guard out of Weber State. Lillard finished with 50 points on 14-of-23 shooting from the field, 8-of-12 shooting from three and 14-of-16 shooting from the free throw line while also handing gout 13 assists, six rebounds and a steal in 38 minutes. With the performance, he became the first player in team history to score at least 50 points three times in one season. It was also the fifth time in NBA history that a player has scored 50-plus points on 23 or fewer field goal attempts. Lillard also joined Stephen Curry as the only players in NBA history to make at least eight three-pointers in three straight games. CJ McCollum shot better than 50 percent from the field and 6-of-9 from three for 28 points in his first performance after missing three games with a sprained left ankle. \"It was tough, it was an emotional day, not just for me, I really feel for my teammates,\" saids McCollum. \"I knew Kobe, we had a decent relationship where we would talk when we see each other but I\u2019m just thankful I was able to express the impact he had on my life, basketball, my work ethic, my approach, my brother\u2019s approach.\" Hassan Whiteside put up another double-double with 21 points and 14 rebounds while also blocking six shots. Carmelo Anthony added 14 points while also grabbing eight rebounds. The Pacers had six players finish in double differs led by 28 points from Jeremy Lamb and 27 points from Domantas Sabonis. \u2022 The Trail Blazers were 20-of-35 (57.1%) from 3-PT range, while the Pacers were 13-of-28 (46.4%) from deep. It was the second straight game and the fifth time in franchise history that Portland has made 20-plus three-pointers. It is the ninth time in NBA history that a team has had 20-plus three-pointers in consecutive games. \u2022 Portland\u2019s 139 points marked the team\u2019s season high\u2022 Portland outrebounded Indiana, 43-31. Indiana\u2019s 31 rebounds were a season low by aTrail Blazers opponent. \u2022 Both teams shot above 50% from the field; the Trail Blazers were 49-of-90 (54.4%)while the Pacers shot 48-of-93 (51.6%). \u2022 Portland had 17 second chance points to Indiana\u2019s 13. \u2022 Indiana dished out 31 assists to Portland\u2019s 27. It was Portland\u2019s fourth game of the season with 27 or more assists. \"I knew Lebron growing up too, and although he\u2019s like Mount Rushmore great, Kobe was the one I didn\u2019t really know, so that was a guy I was afraid to meet. That really hurt, just to see the reception across the country, all of the lives he impacted, people that didn\u2019t know him. It shows you how special he was outside of basketball. I pray for his wife, his family because lord know what they\u2019re going through.\" -- CJ McCollum The Trail Blazers finish off a four-game homestead by hosting the Rockets in the third meeting between the two teams this season Wednesday night at the Moda Center.

In fact, after his last two performances, it's probably safe to say he's a lock. The 6-3 point guard out of Weber State followed up a 62-point performance versus the Warriors Monday night with a 47-point outing Thursday night versus the Mavericks. But despite his best efforts and considerable assistance from his newest teammates, it wasn't enough to avoid a 133-125 loss to a white-hot shooting Dallas Mavericks team in front of a sellout crowd of 19,574 at the Moda Center. \"They\u2019ve proven over the course of the season that they\u2019re the best offense in the league, they cause a lot of problems,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"Doncic does a great job of orchestrating the offense, tonight they had six or seven guys make at least two threes, they came out hot shooting threes well, they scored in transition, they scored in the paint, they got to the free throw line in the second quarter, so they can hurt you in a lot of different ways.\" The Trail Blazers are now 19-27 overall and 10-11 at home this season. With the win, the Mavericks take a 2-1 lead in the season series with one game left to play. The Mavericks put on a three-point shooting clinic in the first quarter, going 10-of-16 from behind the line on the way to scoring 45 points, the most Portland has given up in a quarter this season. With a 15-point lead and just about everything they threw in the general direction of the rim finding the mark, it seemed as though the competitive portion of Thursday's game might have already come and gone. But with back-to-back three-pointers from Trevor Ariza, who started Thursday night in his first game as a Trail Blazer after being acquired via trade from Sacramento on Tuesday, Portland finished the quarter on a 12-5 run to cut Dallas' advantage to eight by the start of the second quarter. \u201cI thought (Ariza) was terrific,\" said Stotts. \"Obviously in the offense, he can make shots, I thought he gave great effort with Porzingis, he had a tough assignment, but I thought he is a welcomed addition. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious he knows how to play and he\u2019s going to help us.\u201d The Blazers tightened up their three-point defense in the second, holding the Mavericks to just 3-of-13 shooting from behind the line. But Portland turned the ball over five times for nine Dallas points and took 10 fewer free throws, resulting in the Mavericks taking a 78-63 lead into the intermission. Dallas took their largest lead of the night at 93-70 with 7:39 to play in the third quarter, and once again, it was fair to assume that an advantage of that size would stunt any attempt by Portland to make a game of it. But it's never safe to assume anything when Damian Lillard is on the court. Lillard, who started the game by making a three-pointer from nearly half court, made three consecutive three-pointers before finishing with 11 points in a 17-0 Trail Blazers run. Carmelo Anthony capped the rally with a 23-foot three-pointer to cut Dallas' lead to 93-85 with 4:23 to play in the third. \u201cWe get down 25 in the third quarter and (Lillard) almost single handedly gets us back in the game,\" said Stotts. \"He\u2019s done that before. I think when he does things like that, everybody believes that somethings possible, and we came up short, but he kept putting us in position to think that we had a chance to win the game, and that\u2019s what big players do.\" Though that would be as close as Portland would come until the final whistle. Dallas responded with a 10-2 run and would eventually go into the fourth leading 103-90. The Mavericks held a double digit lead for the almost the entirety of the fourth quarter before Gary Trent Jr. made a three-pointer in garbage time to get the final deficit to eight. \u201cI think our urgency was better in the second half, but in the first half, we just allowed them to play too comfortable,\" said Lillard. \"Seventy-eight points in the first half is allowing a team to build up too much confidence and rhythm, especially with the level that that offense can play at, it\u2019s putting yourself in a tough position. I thought we competed but the start that we allowed them to get off to put us in a tough position and it was just an uphill battle going into the second half even though we did a much better job, that first half really hurt us.\" Damian Lillard went 16-of-28 from the field, 8-of-15 from three and 7-of-7 from the line to finish with 47 points, eight assists and six rebounds in 41 minutes. With the performance, Lillard joins Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor, Pete Maravich and Devin Booker as the only players to score 108+ points in back-to-back games. Trevor Ariza went 7-of-11 from the field and 4-of-6 from three to finish with 21 points in his Trail Blazers debut while also added seven rebounds, two assists and two steals in 35 minutes. Carmelo Anthony had a double-double of 16 points, 11 rebounds. Hassan Whiteside did the same, but to the tune of 14 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes. Gary Trent Jr. came off the bench to score 20 points. Dallas had seven players finish in doubler figures led by Luka Doncic, who finished with 27 points, nine assists and six rebounds in 34 minutes. Seth Curry and Jalen Brunson each finished with 17 and Tim Hardaway Jr. and Dorian Finney-Smith each had 11. \u2022 The Trail Blazers shot 21-of-39 (53.8%) from the three-point line while the Mavericks were 22-of-47 (46.8%). Portland\u2019s 21 three-pointers tied the franchise record (Jan. 2,2014 vs. Cha. and Dec. 14, 2013 at Phi.). \u2022 The 43 three-pointers made by Portland and Dallas tied the NBA record for three-pointers in a game (Jan. 16, 2019, NOP at GSW). \u2022 Portland had 17 second chance points on 11 offensive rebounds while the Mavericks recorded 14 second chance points on 12 offensive boards. \u2022 Both teams shot above 50% from the field; Dallas was 48-of-93 (51.6%) while Portland shot 46-of-91 (50.5%). \u2022 Dallas attempted 24 free throws (made 15, 62.5%) while the Trail Blazers shot 15 free throws (made 12, 80.0%).\u2022 Portland outrebounded Dallas, 43-41. \"I felt pretty normal once I got on the court. I was a little confused about what we were doing, but once Coach (Terry) Stotts talked to me he told me go out and play, my teammates told me go out and play, so that\u2019s what I was trying to do.\" -- Trevor Ariza The Trail Blazers have two days off again before hosting the Indiana Pacers in the third game of a four-game homestead.

He wakes up every morning now and cannot wait to get to math because at the end he gets to throw a volleyball at his dad.\u201d In his first interview since the NBA season was postponed, the first-year Sacramento coach reflected on his team\u2019s improving play before it was put on hold. \u201cWe were playing high-level basketball,\u201d Walton explained. \u201cAs far as a team embracing what it needs to do. What I mean by that is individuals understanding their roles, individuals understanding what we need out of them and those individuals making sacrifices for the betterment of the team. I think that\u2019s why we were winning games at a pretty solid rate towards the end.\u201d   Our favorite moments of the season will have you missing the squad that much more. A post shared by  Sacramemeto Kings (@sacramentokings) on Apr 6, 2020 at 6:34pm PDT  Walton reflected on the team coming together at the right time, with development from his roster and the newest acquisitions. \u201cAlex [Len] and Kent [Bazemore] coming over to add some toughness and physicality that we needed and the defensive level that was being played,\u201d said Walton of his team\u2019s play. \u201cA big part of it was having De\u2019Aaron [Fox] get going like that and getting to the free-throw line consistently. In the last few games, I know it\u2019s a small sample size, he was shooting around 90 percent and if you get there eight times a game, that is going to help. \u201cBuddy [Hield] was just really dominating his role for us coming off the bench. Bogdan [Bogdanovic] in the starting lineup was making nice basketball plays. We had a lot of good positive things going for us as a team and we were excited. We were looking forward to every matchup that we had, and our guys were giving us everything they had.\u201d Despite the extraneous circumstances, Coach Walton continues to aim for development from his players while the shelter-in-place order is ongoing. \u201cA big part of what I believe in as a coach is player development,\u201d Walton detailed. \u201cThis is a great time for some of those things, whether it\u2019s reading books or listening to podcasts. Meditation is something we encourage our players to do and get into.\u201d While at home, Walton has continued to study film and is encouraged by what he\u2019s seen from his team\u2019s play. \u201cI was really pleased with how we were playing over the last 20-25 games,\u201d Walton continued. \u201cWe were really starting to play some consistent basketball. Defending and playing the way we really wanted to. Guys were really understanding each other and knowing, playing, and feeding off each other. \u201cThere was some really exciting stuff to continue to build on and there were some things that I wanted to try more five-out action with some of our smaller lineups that we were getting to. Having De\u2019Aaron [Fox] back and having him play at the level that he was playing at. Running more of the Pistol action and continuing to give Harrison [Barnes] more looks at the four.\u201d    A post shared by  Sacramemeto Kings (@sacramentokings) on Feb 29, 2020 at 8:31pm PST  Studying film and working with his players aside, Walton is still finding time to unwind, watching \u2018Tiger King\u2019 and most recently, the ESPN Michael Jordan documentary, \u2018The Last Dance.\u2019 \u201cI hope everyone on our team watched it,\u201d Coach Walton said. \u201cI think some of the footage and messaging that\u2019s portrayed, whether it\u2019s from Michael [Jordan] or whoever in those first two episodes, there\u2019s a lot to learn from that. From the challenges of winning to becoming a dynasty \u2014 it was fun to watch.\u201d Finally, Walton is encouraged with his team\u2019s development, whether the 2019-20 season has concluded, or gets underway in the future. \u201cI love where we\u2019re at as a group. I think our future is bright. We have a great group of guys. Winning consistently in any pro sport is hard, but when you get a good group of guys that work hard and like each other and are willing to trust each other, I think this is how you make that happen.\u201d "}

On Thursday, the NBA announced final voting results for the 2020 All-Star Game starters, with Damian Lillard coming in third among West guards, just below the cut line for getting a starting spot, while Carmelo Anthony finished sixth among West frontcourt players. Finishing third in voting, behind Mavericks point guard Luka Doncic and Rockets guard James Harden, is close as Lillard has come to winning a spot as an All-Star starter. The 6-3 point guard in his eighth season out of Weber State finishes third in all three votes -- fan, player and media -- to finish ahead of Houston's Russell Westbrook, Utah's Donovan Mitchell, Phoenix's Devin Booker, Memphis rookie Ja Morant and Oklahoma City's Chris Paul. There was some concern that Lakers reserve guard Alex Caruso, who is averaging 5.5 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 18.9 minutes per game this season, might overtake Lillard after surging up the table in the latest round of fan voting returns. But Lillard finished with 1,337,540 votes to edge out Caruso by roughly 52,000 votes. Again, nice work Trail Blazers fans. As for Anthony, he finished sixth in the overall voting by way of coming in sixth in fan voting, seventh in player voting and eighth in media voting for a weighted score of 6.75, 1.75 behind L.A.'s Paul George for fifth and just 0.25 points more than New Orleans' Brandon Ingram, who finished seventh. The 10-time All-Star also passed the one million mark with 1,058,543 votes in his 17th season. Anthony finishes behind LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard -- all of whom will be starters in there 2020 exhibition -- Nikola Jokic and George. He finished ahead of Ingram, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns. With the starters announced -- LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo will be captains in their respective conferences and will pick their teams from the pool of players form both the East and West -- it's now down to the coaches to select seven players from each conference to fill out the All-Star roster. The result of the coaches vote will be announced Thursday, January 30 on TNT. Lillard, averaging 28.3 points, 7.6 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 37.0 minutes per game this season, is considered all but a lock to make his fifth All-Star Game. Anthony's averaging path to what would be an 11th All-Star appearance is far more uncertain, especially considering that, with a 19-27 record, it's hard to make a case the Trail Blazers should have two All-Stars. Then again, stranger things have happened. The 2020 NBA All-Star Game will be held February 16 at the United Center in Chicago. "}

On a day basketball fans will never forget, Bogdan Bogdanovic was preparing as he normally would for a game. That game, in particular, was one of great importance \u2014 at 28-36, both the Kings and New Orleans Pelicans were fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.   @bogdanbogdanovic with a special message to Kings fans A post shared by  Sacramemeto Kings (@sacramentokings) on Mar 23, 2020 at 10:26am PDT  \u201cWe were so focused on our situation, fighting for the playoffs and a chance to make the postseason,\u201d said No. 8. \u201cAnd now, I'm just trying to think positively about the whole situation. I\u2019m using all this time to work on myself, my body and coming out of this 100 percent.\u201d Before the season was postponed, Bogdanovic was in the midst of a playoff push while also bolstering career-high marks in points (14.5), minutes (28.0) and true shooting percentage (57.0). \u201cI was mainly focused on how to be better in any position the team put me in and how to be a contributor in any way I can,\u201d said Bogi of his season. \u201cIn addition to that, improving my dribbling and ball-handling were goals.\u201d While there are certainly unknowns as to when \u2014 or if \u2014 the NBA season returns, No. 8 already has his favorite moment of the season. Trailing the Minnesota Timberwolves by 17 points with 2:49 left to play, Sacramento capped an incredible comeback just hours after the tragic death of Kobe Bryant.   De\u2019Aaron Fox lasered a free-throw attempt off the front rim in regulation, and Buddy Hield \u2014 a disciple of Bryant \u2014 scored a career-high 42 points on 24 shots for the miraculous OT win. \u201cNone of us could sleep the night before,\u201d Bogdanovic recalls of the emotions preceding that game. \u201cWhen you see the impact he had, to lose a person and legacy like that behind him, it was extremely difficult to play that game\u201d While No. 8 continues a six-day workout regimen throughout the week, the swingman is finding time during quarantine to rest his body.

I was just playing for fun with friends, just to get out of basketball and take my thoughts off the stress and pressure we have all week. It's rare I\u2019d ever play a solo game.\u201d Bogdanovic has instead used his time to give back to the community of his native Serbia, joining Vlade Divac and Nemanja Bjelica to fund the purchase of ventilators, masks and supplies to support hospitals providing services for COVID-19 patients. \u201cWe felt the need to help our own country. It\u2019s the place where we came from and raised, to everyone that helped us, this is the way we can help out. They need our help. We were in a situation where we could help, and we were honored to do so.\u201d Like the rest of us during the shelter-at-home mandate, Bogdanovic is aiming to find a consistent routine to stay in shape, keep his mind right and his body healthy. \u201cIn order to get better, your own routine is important,\u201d Bogi reveals. \u201cI'm getting to know how to prepare and be more efficient with my time. I workout in the garage. I play music, take a shower and get ready to help my sister for lunch. I take my nap during the day and then talk with friends and family.

The Barnes donation will provide weekly family meals, coordinated in partnership with The Center at Sierra Health Foundation, the Black Child Legacy Campaign (BCLC) and the seven BCLC community partner organizations working to prevent and reduce disproportionate African American child deaths in Sacramento. Food is given to families identified by community organizations across Sacramento County. Each box contains non-perishable foods such as pasta, rice and canned goods as well as fresh fruits, vegetables and meat. Additionally, Barnes and his wife will donate Dutch Bros coffee and pastries to physicians and staff working on the front lines in the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento Medical Center\u2019s Intensive Care Unit. These donations are in addition to the more than 1,250 meals donated to families and children in need during the month of April by Barnes and his fellow teammates Bogdan Bogdanovic, De\u2019Aaron Fox, Richaun Holmes and Cory Joseph. \u201cFood accessibility is a health crisis that has always affected underserved communities. This pandemic has really magnified the issue - so we knew this was an area we wanted to focus our efforts,\u201d Barnes said of he and his wife\u2019s community efforts amidst COVID-19. \u201cDuring these uncertain times, we wanted to find a way to serve and be impactful to vulnerable families in our community. My wife and I were privileged to partner with The Center at Sierra Health Foundation and Black Child Legacy Campaign and its trusted partners, who are doing incredible work to ensure families in Sacramento\u2019s most underserved communities have food on the table,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to do a small part in providing more families with food security during these difficult times.\u201d \u201cThe challenges our communities face have been amplified by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Sierra Health Foundation and The Center President and CEO Chet P. Hewitt. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever to support each other and we thank the Barnes family for doing just that with their commitment to this city and its most vulnerable residents.\u201d \u201cIt is so meaningful to our families, our kids and our community to be seen by and have the support of the Barnes family,\u201d said Rose Family Creative Empowerment Center Founder and Director Jackie Rose. \u201cHuge thank you to Harrison Barnes for his support in ensuring our community has the support needed during these times,\u201d said South Sacramento Christian Center Pastor Les Simmons. \u201cIt\u2019s through generosities like yours that we continue to create beloved community.\u201d These donations are part of the team\u2019s \u201cIn This Together\u201d initiative to help support the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the Kings announced that the team\u2019s former arena in Natomas will serve as a surge field hospital to provide care for mild to moderate COVID-positive patients. The Sacramento Kings Foundation will donate $250,000 to area community organizations providing food services, essential supplies and other resources and relief to those hardest hit by the crisis. The team will also donate 100,000 medical-grade masks to state and local hospitals and healthcare institutions with a shortage of supplies. Last month, the Kings joined forces with Legends Hospitality to donate nearly 5,000 pounds of prepared and perishable food to the Sacramento Food Bank and the Sacramento County Office of Education to help feed individuals in need and families impacted by school closures.

Born in French Lick, Indiana \u2014 the same town as Larry Bird \u2014 the 76-year-old Reynolds has served in nearly every capacity during his time in Sacramento. The French Lick native attended Springs Valley High School in Indiana and played college ball at Vincennes University where he also started his coaching career in 1967. Beginning as an assistant coach and developing into a head coach, general manager, adviser and broadcaster, there isn\u2019t a greater embodiment of being Sacramento Proud than the native Hoosier. With his basketball knowledge infinite and stories to last a lifetime, \u201cReynolds Remembers\u201d are tales from Jerry, by Jerry, for the fans. So, let\u2019s hippity-hop to the barber shop with the legend himself. -- It was 1988 or \u201889. My mom was still alive and my brothers lived in French Lick, of course. Larry [Bird] had a home in French Lick at that time. I always spent some time with Larry, and I went over to visit with him, Rick Carlisle and a friend of his. We sat down and had a beer or two, and all of a sudden one of Larry's buddies from high school, we called him \u2018Beezer,\u2019 came over.  He was a point guard on Larry's high school team.  Larry, of course, talked a little trash and would egg me on. Beezer was saying he was the best high school guard to come out of Springs Valley High School in the 70s and I said, \u2018Well I can tell you one thing. I was damn sure the best to come out there in the 60s.\u2019 And so, all of a sudden we need to play one-on-one to decide who the champion really is. Larry initially wanted to be the referee, to which I said, \u2018hell no,\u2019 because I knew I\u2019d never have a fighting chance if he got to call the game for his high school buddy. Rick [Carlisle] said, \u2018I'll call the game.\u2019 Rick decided to call it and we played a one-on-one game, and you want to know what happened? I kicked his hind end and proved to be the dominant force of all guards from Spring Valley High School in the 60s and 70s! Rick Carlisle became the Rick Carlisle that we currently know \u2014 one of the great coaches in the history of the NBA. He proved himself to be a solid referee, too. I won convincingly. That's all I can tell you. Beezer would probably have a little different slant on it, but I thought it was very fair. Meanwhile, it was clear Larry [Bird] was not being very fair in his assessment. He was questioning a few calls and they all seemed to be going Beezer\u2019s way. The final score was 15 to 10. Not bad for the Caucasian Comet. (Yes, that was my nickname growing up, because believe it or not, I used to be incredibly quick.)  Every time I go to French Lick, I spend time with Larry. When he would visit Sacramento, he came over in the evening and would spend time visiting. We'd have a few beers and just talk. Larry used to bust my chops with the trash talk. He\u2019d always be making fun, saying \u2018My God, you guys are slow and old.\u2019 I said of course! I was in my late 40s at that time. And he was in his early 30s. He's a real trash-talker who did a lot when I was coaching. He\u2019d bust my chops and get my guys all screwed up because he'd f--- with them too. I definitely have more stories that I can share of Larry\u2019s trash-talking, maybe for the next chapter.. -- Stay tuned for more stories from the Sacramento legend as \u201cReynolds Remembers\u201d continues throughout 2020.

And there's no wrestler Lillard reveres more than Steve James Anderson, better known as \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. Lillard's admiration for Austin led him to dress up as the brash-talking, beer-swigging grappler for Halloween a few years ago and has continued with adidas making a \"Stone Cold\" colorway of his signature sneaker, the Dame 6. The black/blue/yellow colorway, nods to Austin's predilection for denim and leather vests, features synthetic snakeskin, a callout to Austin's \"Texas Rattlesnake\" nickname, broken glass, a wink to Austin's entrance music, a broken skull and of course \"DAME 3:16\" a takeoff of Stone Cold's biblically-specious \"AUSTIN 3:16\" catch phrase, adorns the midsole. The colorway hits retail on January 25, and WWE wrestler Kofi Kingston wearing the sneaker at the Royal Rumble on January 26. To celebrate the release, Lillard recently spoke about the origins of his love for wrestling, why he's such a big fan of Stone Cold, the\u00a0Attitude Era\u00a0in professional wrestling, Austin's popularity among professional athletes, the similarities between Stone Cold's personality in his ring and his on the court and his thoughts on the new colorway. When did you first become a fan of Steve Austin? Do you remember when you first became aware of who he was? Damian Lillard: My first memory of Stone Cold, he had hair and he wasn't \"Stone Cold.\" And like, I remember something I was always really interested in at that time when I first started watching wrestling -- I was maybe four or five years old -- I just remembered people resurfacing as different characters. Like, how they would be one person and they would come back as somebody else and I'd be like \"He was WCW and now he's WWF as somebody else!\" And that was the first thing I noticed about Stone Cold, and when he came back he was like a completely different character. He was like, just a bad (expletive). He first came in as a pretty boy or something like that, right? Damian Lillard: Stunning Steve or something like that. And I was like \"This dude was somebody else\" and he came back and he was Stone Cold. And he was like a complete different personality, he had all these one liners, baldheaded and he was a villain. By hisself, didn't mess with nobody, drinking beers, flipping people off. I just loved it, that was my favorite personality. It seems like he kind of filled the space between \"good\" and \"bad.\" He wasn't necessarily a babyface nor a heel, he seemed to straddle both. Damian Lillard: Hate to love him or love to hate him. It goes both ways. I don't know exactly how to describe it but it's like he's a bad guy, but people love the bad guy. It was one of those things. His persona really seemed to be about refuting authority, which kind of goes both ways. Damian Lillard: Exactly, a rebel. You don't Stun Vince McMahon, and he would do it. Vince McMahon fired him, he still show up. He did what he wanted to do and it was like, you just love to see that type of life, going against the grain all the time. Just doing what he wanted to do. I loved it.  Share Links:  It seems like a lot of professional athletes are Stone Cold fans and I wonder if there's something specific about why that attitude speaks to athletes. Damian Lillard: I don't give a (care). That mentality is just like, it's a swagger about that persona that he had that, as a kid, I just loved it. Loved it. Nobody could tell him nothing, nobody could punk him. He was the man! He was just the man. I felt like even when everybody loved The Rock, I still was like, he may be bigger than Stone Cold, but he's not quite Stone Cold. I read a quote from Vince McMahon in which he said Stone Cold was the biggest star ever in wrestling. It might have been Hulk Hogan at one point in time, and maybe with all the success that The Rock has had outside of wrestling... Damian Lillard: The Rock post-wrestling, maybe. But in wrestling, I think Stone Cold is the GOAT. You got some people -- Goldberg was known for 73-0 or however many matches. And then you've got Triple H who was just around a long time, was Hunter Hearst Helmsley and then came back as Triple H, a whole different person. And you got Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart, you got all these dues that were great. But Stone Cold was like, a great wrestler and a great entertainer. When he had a microphone... I would look forward to watching him on Raw even when he wasn't wrestling. Just the energy with him, or for him to do something random, him showing up in the grocery store whipping somebody ass, I just looked forward to that, you know what I mean? Nobody else could do what he was doing. Nobody else could do it, and make you really believe this is who he really is. Stone Cold is really one of those guys who it's always like: Is that real? Is it fake? Professional wrestling blurs those lines on purpose, and Stone Cold seemed to be one of the best at it. Damian Lillard: He seemed like that's really who he is. Texas Rattlesnake, Austin 3:16, And That's The Bottom Line. And then he came back later in his career with \"WHAT?\" and the whole arena is like \"WHAT? WHAT?\" And that was after I stopped watching wrestling and he was still like that. It's crazy. I was thinking that, as an athlete, there's probably a level of respect for a guy who suffers a serious injury and then finish the match... Damian Lillard: Didn't he break his neck or something? Yeah, Owen Hart piledrived him and it actually hit and broke his neck. And then to come back and keep wrestling... Damian Lillard: Already had a bad knee. All that did was go deeper into his legacy. Major, major, major legacy. I wonder how much money he was making. I know a lot of those dudes, it's like the old music business or like how boxing was, but I really wonder. He was such a star. I know Rick Flare was making a lot of money, so Stone Cold had to be making a lot of money, had to be. He had merch! All that Stone Cold Steve Austin merch and all that stuff, especially when they made him his own belt. Like, the belt I've got, it's a Broken Skull.  And that\u2019s the bottom line, because @Dame_Lillard said so. pic.twitter.com/JvIMyoVkJQ \u2014 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) October 23, 2018  I saw someone mentioned that about your Stone Cold walk in, that you even had the right belt. Damian Lillard: Yeah, I had the Broken Skull! I had like, his belt. He was champ for so long that he had a belt with a skull on it and it was like the Stone Cold belt. So the next champ pretty much had to have a different belt. It's like, that's the belt that I got, that's how great he is. And then after that you see The Rock come with his belt, you know what I mean? That's different. He had his own belt. He really seems to be special to men of your generation, and might be one of the most popular athletes among athletes. Damian Lillard: For people of my age, his era was at its peak. Attitude Era was at its peak when I was a kid and it was a thing. I feel like they had a lot going on for children. You watch it on TV, they had WWF ice creams, they had WWF toys and action figures and belts and rings. It was just always something. They had merch, you got the shirts, video games. I think because of that, it was just a big deal. That era, the personalities was so strong. Obviously you got Macho Man and Hulk Hogan and guys like that who had big personalities, Ric Flare. But the Attitude Era, it was like, everybody was a major character: The Rock, Stone Cold, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, D-Generation X when Triple H became Triple H, the Nation of Domination. Even the lower level wrestlers, like D'Lo Brown, was like a character... The starts underneath the megastars were megastars: Mankind, The Undertaker, Kane, Ahmed Johnson. You had real stars underneath them that were real stars. It was like, yeah we got the The Rock and Stone Cold, obviously those are \"the guys\" but the dudes under there was real dudes. The Big Show. So I think because that's what it was in the Attitude Era and Stone Cold just stood above all of them with his character. He was a villain, always by hisself, wasn't friends with nobody. If he shared a beer with somebody, that was a big deal. And anybody he was cool with for like 10 seconds, he might turn around and Stun 'em. It was just the thrill of who he was. He wasn't a bad dude -- his character, you didn't look at him like a bad dude -- but he was a bad ass. There's something about it that everybody just loved. He just didn't give a damn about nothing. Do you see yourself at all in that way? I feel like there's some similarities there. Damian Lillard: I do. I see myself in Stone Cold in that he was unapologetically him. And it was like, if this is the rules and this is what I'm supposed to be doing, this is how I feel and this is what I'm gonna do. If that's a problem, then oh well, that's how I feel about stuff. I'm not gonna be somebody or something that I'm not. I'm willing to go great lengths to protect that, I just feel like that's how Stone Cold's character kind of was. I think I see myself in that way. Fearless. And that idea of not carrying if you're going it alone or the idea that, so people aren't behind me or people think I'm crazy or that it might not work out, oh well. I don't care, I'm still going to do it. Damian Lillard: Validation? Don't need it. I had heard that you might try to get to the Broken Skull Ranch at some point. Damian Lillard: I'm a big Stone Cold fan and my trainer, Phil Beckner, he's a huge wrestling fan as well and he loves Stone Cold too. Since we train and spend so much time together in the summer, we just talking about going up to his ranch, spending some time with him, getting some training in on the ranch. Just for the experience, just for the story. It was just a thought. Adidas Hoops has made a \"Stone Cold\" colorway of your signature sneaker, the Dame 6. How'd it turn out? Damian Lillard: I like it. Reason I love it is because the colors represent the beginning stages of when he was Stone Cold. It's not like the peak of Stone Cold. Like, with the yellow, the blue and the black and all that stuff, he always wore blue denim jeans and denim shorts, back t-shirt of a black vest, black knee brace. But the gold was the early WWF, like when the logo was actually gold. Later, like late 90's, it wasn't gold no more, I feel like it was white, but before, it was literally a gold logo and that's kind of what it reminds me of. I like it, I like that there's real detail to what the shoe is about. "}

First and foremost, Wednesday's practice was the first time Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurki\u0107 has participated in a full-contact workout with the team since breaking his left fibula and tibia in a four overtime victory versus the Nets on March 25, 2019. \u201cWith this week, I think a long time ago we looked at this week as far as having two days off three times in this week,\u201d said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \u201cIt was hopeful that this week would be an opportunity for him to ramp up his workouts, but as far as anything else beyond that, it's too early to say.\u201d The 7-0 Bosnian has been going through solo workouts for a while, at least dating back to mid-December, if not earlier, but participating in a full workout with the entirety of the team is a first since suffering the injury. \u201cWe did four-on-four and five-on-five halfcourt stuff today,\u201d said Stotts. \u201c(Nurki\u0107) has been doing that with coaches and some of the younger guys but this is the first time it was five-on-five.\u201d The team has made a point of not giving out too much information about Nurki\u0107\u2019s rehabilitation and return, but his return to full practice was too exciting for some of this teammates to downplay. In a season that has seen injury after injury, seeing a player actually nearing return, especially one as important to Portland\u2019s fortunes as Nurki\u0107, seemed like a reason for optimism in an otherwise disappointing season. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in the situation. I'm not a doctor, I'm not inside of his body,\u201d said Damian Lillard. \u201cBut he looked good to me.\u201d There\u2019s still no timeline for Nurki\u0107\u2019s return, at least not one that has been made public, and Thursday\u2019s practice is just the latest in a series of steps he must take in order to get back on the court this season, so in some respects, it would be foolhardy to place too much emphasis on one practice. But regardless of whether this is one of the final hurdles or a minor step in the process of returning, it does qualify as progress. \u201cHe's been building up to it so it's not like all of the sudden this happened,\u201d said Stotts. \u201cHe's been progressing to this point, so it's not really... I guess it's a milestone but it's just a part of his progression.\u201d Nurki\u0107 wasn\u2019t the only player to participate in workouts not-yet-seen by the media at Wednesday\u2019s practice, There was Zach Collins, sidelined since the third game of the season after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated left shoulder, going through a solo workout. While there was no contact, he did shoot and finish layups using both hands while lifting his arms above his shoulders. Collins isn\u2019t set to be reevaluated until at least March, but Wednesday\u2019s workout was the first time he\u2019s been on the court doing basketball activities when media was let into the gym. The excitement regarding the progress both Nurki\u0107 and Collins showed in their respective rehabilitations Wednesday afternoon, not to mention getting Trevor Ariza, Caleb Swanigan and Wenyen Gabriel in the gym for the first time since being acquired Tuesday from the Sacramento Kings, was not lost on their teammates. \u201cNurk practiced full speed, contact, up and down,\u201d said Lillard. \u201cSo seeing him out there being himself and not looking like he was struggling, seeing Zach out here right now, seeing how Trev (Ariza) looked in practice, it just felt good. It was almost like a pick-me-up. I feel good about it.\u201d \u201cHe's got a great feel for the game, great hands,\u201d said Swanigan, who is now in his second stint with the Trail Blazers. \u201cHe just plays, plays well. Today there were a couple times where he lost it but there was couple times when he dunked it and that's just part of coming back... Nurk looked good, Nurk looked really good.\u201d CJ McCollum, who has missed the last two games with a left ankle sprain, also went through a shooting workout, though Stotts said that was the only part of Wednesday\u2019s practice in which he participated.

Not only did Jusuf Nurki\u0107 return to playing five-on-five for the first time since suffering a horrific leg injury back in March of 2019, three new players acquired via trade from the Sacramento Kings made their practice debuts \u2014 or in the case of one player, a return rather than a debut \u2014 Wednesday morning at the Trail Blazers\u2019 facility in Tualatin. The trade that sent Kent Bazemore, Anthony Tolliver and two future second-round picks to Sacramento in exchange for Trevor Ariza, Caleb Swanigan and Wenyen Gabriel wasn\u2019t finalized until Tuesday morning, meaning the trio of new players had plenty of time to get to Portland in time for practice. Which is a good thing, as all three could very well see action in Thursday\u2019s nationally-televised game versus the Dallas Mavericks at the Moda Center. Ariza, a 6-8 forward in his 16th season out of UCLA, will not only play, but is expected to start Thursday night versus the Mavericks, and likely going forward the rest of the season, after coming off the bench exclusively this year for the Kings. \u201cI feel great, feel blessed,\u201d said Ariza after going through his first practice with his new teammates. \u201cOpportunity to play the game that I\u2019ve been playing since I was a kind, the game that I love. I get another opportunity in a new city.\u201d In 32 appearances this season, Ariza is averaging 6.0 points on 39 percent shooting from the field and 35 percent shooting from three, 4.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.1 steals in 24.7 minutes per game. While his statistics don\u2019t jump off the page, he brings the prototypical NBA small forward height and length, something Portland has been short on this season due to injuries. \u201cA lot of experience, an excellent wing defender, very good three-point shooter,\u201d said Trail Blazers head coach of Ariza. \u201cThat position, we've been a little bit undersized at this wing. I think his experience -- he knows how to play -- I think he'll mesh really well with our starters. Trevor has had a really good career and for good reason: he knows how to play and I think he's a winning player. \u201c While Ariza hasn\u2019t had much time to get up to speed on Portland\u2019s terminology and play calls, having played in 710 games with nine different teams \u2014 12 of you count the teams he\u2019s played for at different points in his career \u2014 and the fact the Blazers have drastically trimmed down their playbook should ease his transition. \u201cAt this point, we've really simplified everything that we've done over the years, so at this point, I don't think it will be that hard to catch on to,\u201d say Damian Lillard. \u201cLike today at practice, they put in some of the sets that we've been running, the things that we do a lot and we didn't have to stop practice to be like 'Alright, this what we gotta do.' He just kinda remembered it, it was pretty simple for him.\u201d It should also be a relatively smooth transition for Swanigan, who appeared in 45 games with the Trail Blazers over his first season and a half in the NBA before being sent to Sacramento in exchange for Skal Labissiere at the 2019 trade deadline. The 6-9 forward, who Portland selected with the 26th overall pick of the 2017 NBA Draft, played sparingly for the Kings, appeared in just 10 games with the Kings since the trade while also spending time on assignment in the G-League. But with so few options at power forward and center, Swanigan is almost sure to see more time on the court in his first few weeks back with the Blazers than he logged during his time with the Kings. \u201cYou don't adjust to it, you just spend your life getting ready for it so when it comes, you can stay ready,\u201d said Swanigan. \u201cThat's what they always say in the NBA: stay ready. You never know how it's going to come, you never know. So that's all I'm going to do, keep working hard and staying ready.\u201d Finally, there\u2019s Wenyen Gabriel, who was only eligible to be traded after the Kings converted his two-way contract to a fully guaranteed NBA contract at the beginning of the 2019-20 season. \u201cI focus every day to go in the gym, work hard and get better,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cAs long as I'm showing progress, measurable progress in a reasonable time, I\u2019m sure the changes in my contract and status and where I'm at is a testament to that. So I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do and I'm going to continue to do that.\u201d The 6-9 forward, who went undrafted after leaving Kentucky after two seasons, has played a total of 61 minutes over the course of 11 game in this, his rookie season. Gabriel has spent most of his time since league Kentucky with the Stockton Kings of the G-League, where he\u2019s averaged 11.4 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and 39 percent shooting form three, 6.9 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 1.1 assists in 49 appearances. \u201cI think I have an opportunity to get in there and play right now, especially with the injuries,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cI feel like that's one of the reasons why I'm here, continue to embrace that. I'm just going to work hard and go out there and play.\u201d If the Trail Blazers weren\u2019t playing without a third of their roster, perhaps Ariza, Swanigan and Gabriel would have a game or two to acclimate before playing significant minutes.

But when pressed on the subject a few minutes later, Lillard had to admit, albeit reluctantly, that he couldn\u2019t be certain he didn\u2019t have some kind of extrasensory capabilities. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d said the 6-2 point guard as out he headed toward the exit of Portland\u2019s locker room. Lillard possessing some sort of preternatural ability would be as good of an explanation as any other for what he was able to do Monday night. His 61 points Monday night constitute a new career and franchise high in scoring, eclipsing his own record by a single point. His 11 made three-pointers is also a career and franchise record, and he is now the only player in NBA history who has scored at least 60 points and made at least 10 three-pointers in a game. And his 16 free throws on 16 attempts ties the franchise record for most makes without a miss. \u201cYou kind of run out of adjectives for Damian and his performance,\" said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. \"The way he carried the team, not just on the court but in the huddles, timeouts, halftime, his leadership was great. You run out of adjectives, he\u2019s an amazing player.\" Lillard now has the high scoring mark in the NBA this season and has scored at least 60 points twice this season, something that had never been done even once in the first 49 years of the Trail Blazers' existence. What's more, he joins Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Michael Jordan, James Harden and Kobe Bryant as the only players in NBA history with multiple 60-plus points games in the same season. \"We needed a win tonight,\" said Lillard. \"It would have been a tough one for us to give up. We\u2019ve got a good home stretch of games, a good opportunity to get some wins against some tough teams on our home floor so it was necessary and it was on time.\" So while what Lillard has done this season is hardly common, there is some precedent, though it's hard to watch him play on nights like Monday without coming away with the sense that there's something bordering on the unexplainable taking place. And sure, Damian probably doesn't possess super powers, but it seems at least debatable that he owns a will power that can only be summoned by a select few. How else does one explain an ability to change an outcome of an event through belief? How does one obtain an unflinching unwillingness to give up on a game, on a season, on a franchise when most everyone else has? \"That's just not who I am,\" said Lillard, who went 11-of-37 from the field and 11-of-20 from the three while also added 10 rebounds and seven assists in 45 minutes. \"I don't know what explanation to give you, that's just not who I am. Anything I'm a part of, I always think it's a chance. It's as simple as that. You show that belief with your actions and your body language and your attitude all the time, so it's not like I was having a good game tonight so everybody believed because I believed. It's like, they know my disposition all the time, they know my attitude and personality all the time.\" When the Warriors started the second quarter on a 19-4 run, which including Golden State scoring the first 12 points of the quarter, Lillard didn't flinch. When Golden State opened the second half by going 8-2 to push their lead back to double digits, Dame kept going. And when his teammates missed open three-pointers one after the other -- take away Lillard's makes and Portland went just 3-of-24 from behind the arch -- he kept feeding them the ball. \"We walked through shootaround and did everything we needed to do,\" said Lillard. \"Even when I went home after shoot around, it was just one of those days, when I came here, I wasn\u2019t coming here to lose this game and it was as simple as that.\" Some might call it denial, but to Lillard, it's just the way he was made. It might not be supernatural, but it's certainly not normal. "}

This initiative is designed to align with the NBA\u2019s league-wide campaign \u2013 to help the global NBA community during these unprecedented times. The NBA is encouraging teams to develop programming in four categories: Know the Facts, Acts of Caring, Expand Your Community and NBA Together Live. To do this, the Sacramento Kings, Stockton Kings, Kings Guard Gaming and Golden 1 Center will join forces, using our digital platforms, community partners and the voices of players, coaches, broadcasters, game-night hosts and more to educate, entertain, provide support and bring acts of kindness or \u201cKings-ness\u201d to families and fans across our community. To tip-off these efforts, we debuted a video narrated by the radio voice of the Kings, Gary \u201cThe G-man\u201d Gerould which gives a nod to the tremendous spirit of our fans in the face of adversity and shares an uplifting message of togetherness and hope for the future. We are committed to looking out for one another as we work to get through this together and remain #SacramentoProud. We have already begun to activate, from producing PSAs to donating our food to local schools that need it. But there is always more we can do. Some highlights of what we are already doing and what we will continue to do are outlined below. KNOW THE FACTS We know there is a lot of information about COVID-19 floating around. We have always believed it was important to share the most reliable information from public health officials to our fans to help flatten the curve. We have been using our platforms to amplify the latest news from California public health officials and partners like the American Red Cross Gold Country and Sacramento County to help support our communities during this unprecedented situation. Kings chairman, CEO and owner Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, forward Marvin Bagley III and guard Bogdan Bogdanovic have also shared tips for staying healthy and active. And we are working with Golden 1 Credit Union to provide fans with the financial resources and content they need to stay healthy financially. For additional information, which is updated daily, on how to reduce coronavirus risk visit Know the Facts: Coronavirus, featuring guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and health experts. ACTS OF CARING We have long believed in using basketball as a platform for social good. Now, more than ever, we are all seeking positive and hopeful inspiration. We are using our platform to connect our families, fans and community by sharing acts of kindness, or as we call it, \u201cActs of Kings-ness.\u201d For example, we joined forces with Legends Hospitality to donate nearly 5,000 pounds of prepared and perishable food to the Sacramento Food Bank and the Sacramento County Office of Education to help feed individuals in need and families impacted by school closures. We will host a blood-drive with Budweiser, who is working with the Red Cross to set up events across the country. To help keep your home team focused while schools are closed, our partner Xfinity has curated a library of free educational resources for all ages. We have also created fun coloring sheets and downloadable activities in partnership with First 5 California for our youngest Kings fans available for free at Kings.com/Together. And we are going to expand on these community activities to include providing giveaways like signed Kings merchandise to local businesses that are providing essential services to the community. EXPAND YOUR COMMUNITY During these times, we are still social, just socially distant, which is why we are doing our part to build community virtually. As Kings employees are now working from home, we are encouraging team members to keep in touch by submitting photos showing how they are \u201cIn This Together\u201d as it relates to a specific action \u2013 to start we are calling for submissions that show Sacramento Kings, Stockton Kings, Kings Guard Gaming or Golden 1 Center pride while working from home. And fans can join in too, just tag your photo with #InThisTogether for a chance to be featured on our social channels. You can also listen to our \u201cGolden 1 Center Work From Home\u201d Spotify playlist while you work \u2013 we plan to update these often and have one for every mood available at Golden1Center.com. We will begin posting at-home workout videos presented by Nike featuring Kings game night host Katerina Kountouris. And we know parents are eager to give their Jr. Kings something to do, which is why Kings Legend and color analyst Doug Christie, Kings Legend and player development assistant coach Bobby Jackson and Stockton Kings head coach Ty Ellis will be leading at-home basketball drills for kids. Parents deserve to have fun too, so we are working with the 916 Crew to put together at-home dance lessons anyone can join. We hope fans participate and enjoy these opportunities to up their game through free videos available on Kings social channels. NBA TOGETHER LIVE We miss our games as much as our fans do. To help ease the pain, Kings fans are reliving the excitement of select Kings \u201cClassic Games\u201d from 2017 to 2020 on NBC Sports California through April 15. We have even recorded some new commentary from Kings forward Harrison Barnes about a select number of games. We will also launch a contest where fan-submitted videos will get Kings broadcaster Grant Napear\u2019s famous \u201cIf you don\u2019t like that, you don\u2019t like Kings basketball!\u201d treatment. We also miss watching world-class talent perform at Golden 1 Center, which is why we are encouragingfans to watch Pay It Forward LIVE, a digital concert series from Verizon that will benefit small businesses impacted by COVID-19. These efforts are just the beginning, and fans are encouraged to visit Kings.com/Together and the organization\u2019s social channels daily for a variety of activations. The coronavirus public health crisis has created a complicated and fluid situation that transcends sports and entertainment. The Kings have always been one giant, global family, and we are committed to uniting together as we all grapple with the impact of the coronavirus by spreading awareness of the facts, sharing acts of \u201cKings-ness\u201d and supporting our community as we all work through these tough times. Kings fans have stood by us through good times and bad, and in the face of uncertainty, we grow ever more resilient. Stay healthy and strong \u2013 we will overcome this too. We are \u201cIn This Together.\u201d "}

This week, we spoke with Executive Assistant to Kings General Manager and Player Service Administrator Penny Chatzis, who shares with us her journey, role models, and the importance of inclusion in today's workplace. How would you describe your role and responsibilities with the Sacramento Kings? My roles and responsibilities at the Sacramento Kings include various duties within basketball operations. I proactively manage the day-to-day needs and provide support to the General Manager, Vlade Divac, as well as the assistant General managers and front office. I also oversee Player Services and Player Relations. I am responsible for onboarding players and welcoming them and their families to our incredible city, and assist with community integration. I help manage player community appearances and facilitate communications between players and the League office, business operations, and front office staff. What do you enjoy most about what you do? What I enjoy most about my job is building meaningful relationships and trust with the players and their families. I enjoy taking care of them and making sure they feel that Sacramento is their home. I want their time in Sacramento and their experience here to be top-notch. Who have been your biggest role models? I would have to say that my biggest role model is my mom. She is fearless and inquisitive. She has taught me to never be afraid to ask questions. If there is something she doesn\u2019t know how to do, she doesn\u2019t rest until she figures it out or completes the task at hand. She is the most courageous woman I know. How do you think companies can strive to be more inclusive to women in the workplace? Companies can strive to be more inclusive to women in the workplace by creating a better work environment for everyone through smart policies and positive work environments. An atmosphere where everyone is expected to bring his or her own cultural and intellectual perspectives to the table. Unfortunately, we still live in a culture where women must provide more evidence of their competence, but are penalized for being too assertive. What advice would you give to other women trying to break into the sports and entertainment industry? The advice I would give women trying to break into the sports and entertainment industry is: Never be one to shy away from a challenge, be open-minded, and willing to prove yourself and your uncanny ability to relate to people, players and a community. How important is it to you to work for an organization that constantly strives to bring greater awareness and equity to women in the workplace? I feel very blessed to work for an organization like the Sacramento Kings that allows me to enjoy the same rewards, resources and opportunities as everyone else and considers the fact that I am a wife and a mother a resource, and not a hindrance.

Although Jenner, once known as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Athlete,\u201d never suited up for the Kings \u2013 opting to continue her illustrious track and field career \u2013 she continues to blaze a trail nearly 40 years later. In recognition of Pride Month, Kings.com caught up with Sacramento native, ESPN editor/writer, civil rights activist, Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame inductee and GLAAD Board Member Christina Karhl \u2013 who publicly came out as transsexual in 2003 \u2013 to gain insight into the impact of Jenner\u2019s courageous story and the value of inclusion in sports. Although you now call Chicago home, after graduating from high school in Sacramento in 1985, how do you characterize your allegiance to the Kings? \u201cI still follow the team. I\u2019m still not over the heartbreak of 2002, frankly, losing the Western Conference Finals the way we did, because it was such a great team to watch. It was the kind of team playing the kind of basketball that was distinctive and so much fun to watch.\u201d Prior to the franchise\u2019s arrival in Sacramento, did you know that Caitlyn Jenner was selected by the Kansas City Kings in the 1977 NBA Draft? \u201cI did not, wow! That is one of those tidbits I put in the same category as Dave Winfield being drafted in four different sports. Because when you\u2019re a tremendous athlete, people are going to take a flyer and maybe it\u2019s a news blurb, but you never know, so that\u2019s very cool.\u201d Does that make her the first trans athlete to be drafted into one of the four major American sports leagues?  \u201cI would have to guess, probably, possibly, at this point, because one of the problems with trans history is we know so little of our own history and so much of it has either been hidden or undiscussed. Trans people, when they came out in the 60s or 70s, were encouraged by their therapists, their doctors, you name it, to bury their past, break from their past, bury their former identity and completely close the door on their previous existence as an adaptive strategy. As a result, because people were encouraged to make that choice, it kind of handicaps a lot of efforts to put together really comprehensive trans history.\u201d How do you feel Caitlyn\u2019s story can help fellow athletes with gender dysphoria make the transition?  \u201cI think it\u2019s hugely important to have possibility models to make people understand effectively we shouldn\u2019t be gendering activities in a sense. It kind of goes to the notion that girls don\u2019t play sports \u2013 well, yes, they do. This is something where you could talk about someone like \u2026 (Kings Assistant Coach) Nancy Lieberman. She played in the USBL against men. Nancy Lieberman\u2019s ability, her talent, her drive to succeed, her excellence has nothing to do with whether or not she\u2019s a man or a woman, it has everything to do with she\u2019s an athlete and she was a great athlete and she should be on the court. Extending the message to say that includes trans people too. If you\u2019re trans and you like sports, there\u2019s nothing wrong. If you\u2019re a trans man who likes sports or a trans woman who likes sports, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you like sports, it\u2019s just part of who you are and it\u2019s not a gendered activity. It\u2019s just something you want to do. It\u2019s part of whom you are and what you drive to achieve \u2013 essentially, extending that message and allowing trans people to realize this is another area of society they should feel fully able to participate in. Why would you take sports away from anybody? Sport is awesome! It\u2019s fun to play, fun to watch. Whatever your intersection with sport, if you\u2019re engaged with it and you\u2019re enjoying it, go for it! So Caitlyn Jenner is awesome as a symbolic coming out moment for people to be able to have this conversation. It\u2019s a great place for people to start it from, to be able to say, \u2018Hey, if somebody as prominent as Caitlyn Jenner can come out and can also be a world-class athlete, or has been a world-class athlete\u2026\u2019 Doesn\u2019t that help create positive conversations around, \u2018I\u2019m just a kid who wants to play soccer\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m just a kid who wants to play little league\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m just a kid who wants to go out for the basketball team?\u2019 It becomes less alien to people\u2019s experience as a concept that trans people like to do the same things everybody else likes to do.\u201d How would you characterize trans awareness since Jenner\u2019s announcement?  \u201cI think awareness of people in the mainstream of trans people, it\u2019s definitely helped. Trans people awareness for themselves was already there. It\u2019s a small community. Even if you accept the numbers, it\u2019s 1 in 10,000 births, 700,000 trans people total in the country. You\u2019re still talking about a really tiny population of people. But thanks to the Internet, a lot of us have already been in communication with each other, know a lot about each other, have been working together whether it\u2019s on policy issues or rights issues, or you name it. It\u2019s not a very big community in the first place and that\u2019s where you have national organizations of parents of trans kids working together to try and help their kids get a fair shake in school. We\u2019re already aware of our fights. I think the question is to what extent does Caitlyn Jenner create an opportunity for us to have a public conversation about effectively what do trans people need to get their fair share and their opportunities as well.\u201d What are the most meaningful ways people and athletes can continue to spread support and education about civil rights topics?  \u201cTrans people are all kind of automatically put in the position of being accidental activists. I\u2019m a sports writer. I didn\u2019t choose to be an activist but it\u2019s kind of something you get sucked into because you see something wrong and you decide to do something about it. I think that perspective is valuable for anybody, trans or not. If you see injustice, if you see something that isn\u2019t right, if you see something that needs fixing and isn\u2019t fair, you could work on it.\u201d To learn more about trans athletes, visit TransAthlete.com.

We sat down with Filipino members of the Kings organization to learn more about what they do and how they honor their heritage. Kyle Ramos is a Social Producer for the Kings and here\u2019s what he had to say. How would you describe your role with the Sacramento Kings? My role is helping to create day-to-day content for both the Sacramento Kings social media channels as well as Kings Guard Gaming. This includes live game coverage and also creating content like blogs, photo galleries, and of course memes. Who have been your biggest role models? I would say my family has served as great role models for me. My parents have worked relentlessly to provide a great life for me and have been so supportive of me in pursuing my dreams. My two older sisters have always had my back and I\u2019m proud to see them thriving in their own careers. Outside of them, I really look up to Donald Glover. His work has inspired me to create with honesty and without limiting myself. Why do you think it\u2019s important to celebrate your Filipino roots? It\u2019s of the utmost importance to reflect on your roots and where you came from. I\u2019m proud to be Filipino and have never shied away from it. Seeing the deep love that the Philippines has for basketball is something that connects with me on the deepest level \u2013 they love the sport. It\u2019s been disappointing to me that we haven\u2019t seen more Filipino representation in the NBA over the years but I\u2019m optimistic that we can see an increase in the very near future. What do you enjoy most about what you do? What I enjoy most is that at the end of the day, I get to do something I\u2019m passionate about for a team that I care so much about. There are so many times when I\u2019m standing on the court at Golden 1 Center capturing content and I just take a step back to realize where I am. I look over at the fans waiting to watch their favorite players and their favorite team and I\u2019m reminded that not long ago I was in their shoes. It\u2019s an incredible blessing that I get to work with so many talented people and that I can connect with Kings fans around the world with what I create. It is very much a dream come true. Why is it important to continue to encourage diversity and representation in the workplace? Diversity and representation are important in the workplace because I feel like it creates a feeling of inclusion for everyone. It also helps to have a variety of perspectives from so many different viewpoints that can help an organization progress. "}

This week, we spoke with Director of Community Impact Betty Low, who shares with us her journey, role models, and the importance of inclusion in today's workplace. How would you describe your role and responsibilities with the Sacramento Kings? My role and responsibility with the Sacramento Kings is to develop and maintain strong relationships with a diverse and reflective group of our community partners. Our working partnerships with our community partners are very important to us. We work collaboratively with many of our community based nonprofit service providers and school partnerships to support our community as a whole. What do you enjoy most about what you do? I enjoy connecting with our diverse community at all levels. I enjoy sharing the experiences of an NBA game with our community members that wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to come to a game. I enjoy meeting and learning about the small budding new nonprofits to our cornerstone community based organizations and the services they provide the community. I enjoy connecting our fans, community members, corporate partners, and staff to the diversity of community organizations, social service providers, and public and private agencies who provide invaluable support services to our community. I enjoy collaborating with our corporate partners to deliver impactful programs like Math Hoops to students. Who have been your biggest role models? My family has been my biggest role models. My mom is representative of the classic immigrant mother, learning the language, working multiple jobs to support our family, juggling all the needs of three children while modeling and teaching us the value of love, loyalty, laughter, home cooked meals, and being the ultimate sports fan.  She unconditionally supported my oldest brother\u2019s dream to be a medical doctor, my second oldest brother to be a law enforcement officer and my goal to be a social worker. She spent many weekends cooking for the many friends, colleagues and coworkers both my brothers brought home for a traditional Chinese meal. I developed my love for basketball because of my mom.  She loves the game and still watches all the games she can on NBA TV. She independently cared for my Dad during his 10 year battle with Alzheimer. She is an amazing Grandmother to 4 loving grandchildren, our grounding force and guiding star that reminds us that life is good. How do you think companies can strive to be more inclusive to women in the workplace? I think companies can be more inclusive to women in the workplace by making a commitment to continue to challenge the status quo of who is at the table leading the organization. Inclusion is an action and leaders can actively create space for mentoring, invest in staff development, promote professional growth and diversify outreach and hiring. What advice would you give to other women trying to break into the sports and entertainment industry? Don\u2019t give up. Be resilient. Keep learning, growing, working and developing relationships in the field. Find your foundation and develop your passion in something that makes you unique. How important is it to you to work for an organization that constantly strives to bring greater awareness and equity to women in the workplace? It\u2019s very important to work for an organization that supports and encourages staff development and growth, equity among all levels of staff and recognizes hard work and dedicated staff. It\u2019s great when women in leadership take the responsibility to make room at leadership circles for other diverse leaders in women and people of color!!! Empowered leaders empowering others to grow and contribute is key to our collective success! "}

We sat down with two Filipino members of the Kings organization to learn more about what they do and how they honor their heritage. Mark Paragas and Jake Soriano are both Video Producers for the Kings and here is what they had to say. How would you describe your role with the Sacramento Kings? Mark: My role with the Kings is to tell the many different stories of the organization through video. It\u2019s an important role because we get to create that connection between our team and our fans on a more personal level. We get to show the fans a more unique perspective on our team on and off the court. Jake: I am responsible for producing various types of videos for any digital, marketing, or departmental needs. In addition, I shoot video of our games at Golden 1 Center and on the road. Who have been your biggest role models? Mark: My biggest role models are my teammates that I work with every day - Brad, Keven, Davon, and Jake. Their creativity and ability to lift each other up is what inspires me the most. This is only my second full-time season with the Kings, and I\u2019m always learning from my team every day. Jake: My biggest role model in my life has been my Mom. Back in 2014 she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and my life has changed ever since. Before she was diagnosed, she was one of the healthiest individuals I\u2019ve ever met. To see her go through what she had to endure has inspired me to live life to the fullest. She has shown me how short life can be and I truly would not be where I am at without her. She is the reason why I do what I do and why I am so motivated to live out my dream. She is now 6+ years cancer free and living her best life with my Dad by traveling the world. #LizzStrong Why do you think it\u2019s important to celebrate your Filipino roots?  Mark: It\u2019s important to celebrate my Filipino roots because that\u2019s where our tradition and values lie. It honors our ancestors whose resilience has allowed us to live the way we do today. It\u2019s also our responsibility to be able to pass down our knowledge and culture to our future generations, so they may one day do the same. Jake: I think it\u2019s important because we need to remember how we got here. I\u2019ve been told stories from my Grandpa from his time growing up in the Philippines and it is drastically different from my childhood here in Sacramento. It\u2019s something we all take for granted. In the Philippines, you were assigned a job in the corn fields as early as the age of 10. When I was 10, I was playing basketball and video games worry-free. If it were not for all the sacrifices and hard work from the Filipino generations before me, then I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. It\u2019s an honor to have a night where our pride and accomplishments of being a Filipino can be celebrated. What do you enjoy most about what you do? Mark: I love my job! I get to be creative everyday and work for the team that I grew up rooting for. Everyday is different in terms of shooting and editing. I get to create unique bonds with our players and staff. Most of all, I get to work with the most talented individuals in the NBA! Jake: The most enjoyable part about this job is what I get to do every day and the people I get to do it with. I get to shoot and edit videos for my favorite team in the world with the most creative group of individuals. I specifically remember my Dad taking me as a kid to my first Kings game at Arco Arena and I started crying because it was so beautiful. To be able to combine both my passion for the Sacramento Kings and my passion for creating is something I can only dream of. Why is it important to continue to encourage diversity and representation in the workplace? Mark: It\u2019s important to encourage diversity and representation in the workplace because having different voices and perspectives matter. Ideas and creativity from people of different cultures make for a healthier work environment.  It is important to provide others an equal opportunity to speak up and contribute to the success of our organization. Jake: Diversity in the workplace is important to me because it gives me a sense of comfort. When I see teammates that look like me or don\u2019t look like me, it makes me feel like I can be my true self. I also believe that with diversity comes different ideas and opinions. This creates a healthy open dialogue, especially in my creative position. If we were all the same, there would be no challenge for change. "}

This week, we spoke with Director of Event Production Cicely Nash. How would you describe your role with the Sacramento Kings? As Director of Event Production for the Sacramento Kings, I oversee the execution of all Kings related events and special events at Golden 1 Center along with managing our dedicated events team. Who have been your biggest role models? I have been blessed to have so many role models through my personal life and career. My former supervisors Monique Boyd and Toni Hill are a few of my important mentors that I always look for advice in my career. Growing up in a sports family surrounded by men, my role models have also been amazing men in my family, colleagues, and peers that steered me in the right direction when facing challenges or questions. In what ways do you celebrate your African American heritage? I make a conscious effort of being proud and celebrating my heritage as a black woman every day.  I strive to be a mentor to young black professionals seeking guidance within the early stages of their careers. African American history is American history so I also try to learn as much history outside of what has been taught in schools through reading literature, visiting museums, and various media platforms. I also pay close attention in spending my money on local black businesses or entrepreneurs within the community in hope of playing a small part in pushing revenue to those outlets. What advice would you give to fellow African Americans who are striving to succeed in the sports and entertainment industry? I would say to anyone that is young and striving to have a career in this business is to continue to be patient and nurture your career. We tend to have falsehoods about quick promotions within our positions when we haven\u2019t taken the time to truly experience and understand if that career falls in line with our passion or goals in life. Being a minority in the workplace, you are ultimately required to work harder than your colleagues because you will have many situations where you are treated differently but you cannot allow that to deter you from your success. You should also strategically create a network of people both in and out of your culture that are advocates in the growth of your career. Unfortunately, a majority of executives in the room who are making employment decisions will most likely not look like you so you have to ensure that you are creating a community of leaders who can speak on your behalf when opportunities arise. Your reputation and work ethic in this industry are critical to defining your value within a sports organization. I would not have had the pleasure of working in this industry over the past 11 years without these attributes and awareness of learning from a diverse background of people.  Keeping a positive attitude, hard work, networking, and appreciating a diverse community is the formula to being successful in this industry. What do you enjoy most about what you do? I enjoy having the opportunity to create memorable experiences for our guests in producing their events.  The experiences that we offer allows my typical day to never be the same and I am continually motivated by our guests, who may have never been to Golden 1 Center, leave our events with amazement. I tend to thrive on stressful moments and managing behind the scenes to ensure our guests have a first-class experience. This has always been the perfect job for me as it combines my love for sports and passion for events! Why is it important to continue to encourage diversity in the workplace? Diversity in the workplace is vital to the success of businesses in our current climate. Creating a culture within a company that allows a variety of perspectives in making decisions increases profitability, creativity, productivity, and impact. This type of workplace cultivates a better environment that influences the community of people to believe that they want to be a part of a company that believes in learning and growing among each other. People naturally want to see others that look like them in the workplace among all levels of positions (including leadership roles) to be inspired in ultimately paying it forward for the next generation of employees.

Among those attendees were Kings players, former and new, as well as front office members from the organization. The team played the Clippers on Saturday afternoon and made a point of staying in L.A. through the weekend to return to Staples Center for the historic memorial. Kings Forward Harrison Barnes described the service as, \u201ca beautiful celebration of Kobe and Gigi and all the victims of the crash.\u201d Barnes continued, \u201cIt definitely puts in perspective the platform that we have and the blessing it is every single day to come out here and play\u2026but also the opportunity we have to inspire people.

She delivered two beautiful eulogies to honor her late husband and daughter and kept remarkable composure for the duration of her twenty minutes on the stage. \u201cVanessa being strong enough to be able to do that [speech] was great,\u201d De\u2019Aaron Fox commented. \u201cObviously, it was emotional being there. It was great that we were able to be there to support. I mean, Kobe was one of our own. [The NBA] is a fraternity. Not a lot of guys can really say that they were able to play in the NBA.

Brian is famous around the Kings offices for his contagious energy, unwavering positivity, and larger than life passion for the work he does. How would you describe your role with the Sacramento Kings? I really like my role. I would say it is definitely more of a mentorship at this time. I've been doing this for 27 years working in professional sports sales. So, a lot of the younger [sales] reps in my department and even in other departments are able to listen to me on the phone and my approach to selling and hopefully they're able to take some of what I say and use my experience and communication skills to help them sell as well. Who have been your biggest role models in life? I'd have to save Martin Luther King Jr. Growing up and reading about him and being a Christian man myself, I admired his approach that love and non-violence is the way to get things accomplished in this country. Some of the racial tensions that we have and things that are going on in this world, the way to defeat them is with love. So, I'd have to say that he is definitely a big hero of mine. Also, my mother is very successful. She's retired now, but she was the vice president and Senior Creative Director for the largest African American advertising agency in the world. She was also the vice president of Motown records for a while. She\u2019s definitely one of my heroes as well for sure. How does she inspire you? Being a female in the corporate world, she was successful back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s when a lot of wonderful women hadn\u2019t made the progress that we've made now in the new millennium, so I'm proud of her for that. She was a big contributor. She worked with Bill Clinton on the Bill Clinton campaign in 1992. And she was voted one of the Top 50 African American Business Women of All Time by Essence Magazine. I'm extremely proud of her. In what ways do you celebrate your African American heritage? On Martin Luther King Jr. day, we generally do a walk through Sacramento. Also, my lady and I watch a lot of African American history programs, just not to forget that we've come a long way in this country as an African Americans. Even though, obviously, there's some still some issues, if you look at where we were from slavery all the way up to civil rights to where we are now\u2026God has been good. What advice would you give to fellow African Americans who are striving to succeed in the Entertainment/Sports industry? This is so clich\u00e9, but the first thing is to get your education. Education is always key. You obviously want to graduate high school, but then after that, pursue an education at a four-year university. If your route has to be junior college and then to move on to a four-year university, that's fine. Also, find some good mentors. My grandmother told me a long time ago, and I'll never forget it, \u201cBrian, if you want to do something, you need to get with the people that are doing it.\u201d My mother always taught me that if you go for your passion, the money will follow. Don't just get a job because you want to get paid a lot of money. Think about it what it is that you really want to do, what you have a passion for, and the money will follow. Why is it important to you to continue to encourage diversity in the workplace? I believe the more diverse we are, the better we are as an organization. Not just at the Sacramento Kings, but across the board in the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, and so on. I feel like each culture brings a certain skill set. We're all different, our cultures are different, and we all have different talents. So, it\u2019s important that you're not just getting talent from one culture or one demographic. [Diversity] makes you better because you're able to get fresh new ideas. You can look at someone else's culture or the way they do things and find a way that you can bring that to the table of what we do. You just learn more. I think I speak for everyone at the office when I say that you are one of the most positive people here. Where did you get such a passionate zest for life? First of all, I just want to say thank you and God bless you. I get that simply from my faith and my belief in God. He teaches me that you're going to come up against opposition. There's going to be things that don't go your way. But, don't let that steal your joy. Believe it or not, no matter what you're going through, there's always millions of people that would love to take your place and would think that your life is great. Sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to continue to have a great attitude and love people even when they don't reciprocate or give it back to you. But, the Lord tells me that I'm blessed regardless as long as I proactively do it. You can't control somebody else's response or what they will say or do, but it's my job to stay positive. That's what I was put on this Earth for. "}

CEO &amp; Co-Founder Mathew Magno. \u201cNot only did we make connections with people who, instead of letting the problems of the world daunt them, are working to fix the world, but we met many people that are helping and supporting us today to excel our company.\u201d \u201cAfter Capitalize, Japa, Inc. has been growing tremendously. We have secured four new clients (SMUD, UCSB, Woodland and UC Berkeley) with a lot more in our pipeline. Two new partnerships are in the works, and we are close to closing our $1 million seed round and plan to do a big hire once completed.\u201d \u201cThe value of this contest for us came in the form of amazing media coverage, connections for potential clients and partnerships, and, more importantly, getting our name and product out to the public! The Kings Capitalize competition is a great stage for startups/companies to let our community know of the amazing innovations that are on the way.\u201d The Makers Place, 2019 Finalist The Makers Place is an intentionally-designed multipurpose space where working parents can create, connect and collaborate while their young children are cared for onsite. As a finalist in the 2019 competition, The Makers Place shared what the company learned while participating in the contest: \u201cBeing involved in Capitalize really helped us clarify the next level of programs and services we wanted to offer as we developed our pitch. It was also very powerful to be surrounded by so many other driven entrepreneurs with bold ideas for local innovation and change,\u201d said The Makers Place Co-Founder and Community Manager Leslie Bosserman. \u201cI would encourage businesses in the startup or expansion stage to apply to participate with the intention of making strong connections and clarifying their purpose and impact.\u201d PROTXX, 2018 Winner PROTXX integrates wearable sensors and advanced data analytics into non-invasive clinical tools that address unsolved challenges presented by complex medical conditions in which multiple physiological systems are impaired. Here is how the company has developed since winning first place in the 2018 Capitalize contest: \u201cThe contest was a key event in launching market engagement at PROTXX, by helping to introduce the company to some of our first pilot deployment partners,\u201d said PROTXX CEO and Founder John Ralston. \u201cPROTXX was originally founded to address the challenges encountered by athletes following concussions, by developing an unobtrusive sensor that could monitor an athlete\u2019s head impact exposure over time and quantify resulting changes in physiological performance. Following our Capitalize win, engagements with college/professional sports organizations and clinical/rehab medicine providers in the Sacramento area revealed the applicability of the PROTXX solution to a much broader range of degenerative neurological conditions.\u201d In addition to offices in Menlo Park and Sacramento, CA, PROTXX has now opened a Canadian office in Calgary, Alberta. Their first revenue-generating product was released in 2019, and today they have customers in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Japan. Trifecta, 2017 Winner Trifecta is one of the nation\u2019s largest all-organic meal delivery services, offering food that suits many different diet types and a la carte options. The 2017 Capitalize winner shared multiple takeaways they gathered from the experience: \u201cTrifecta gained a huge amount of publicity, investor introductions, free brand visibility, and of course, $10,000 in cash from winning the Kings Capitalize contest. We honed our investor presentation skills and were able to connect with venture capitalists to present the company and brand as we were scaling,\u201d said Trifecta Co-Founder and CEO Greg Connolly. \u201cWe became widely recognized as the #1 startup in the Sacramento region, and have gone on to be a beacon for the startup community \u2013 proving that it can be done in Sacramento and that there is a support system in the investor and startup community.\u201d \u201cI would encourage early-stage CEOs to apply for the Kings Capitalize contest for the visibility, practice pitching your company, connections to the investor community, and of course, the $10,000 is a welcome bonus for any early-stage startup.\u201d The Capitalize contest aims to provide all participants with valuable insight and business advice from industry professionals.

On Oct 31, 1950, Earl Lloyd broke the League\u2019s color barrier when he entered the game for the Washington Capitols against the Rochester Royals (which today are now the Sacramento Kings). While it marked a historical moment, he described it as ordinary in an interview years later. \"Rochester was a sleepy upstate town where schools were integrated and they were used to seeing blacks and whites playing together,\" he told Jack Saylor of the Detroit Free Press on the 50th anniversary of the game. \"The game was totally, unequivocally uneventful except for the date \u2014 Oct. 31. Maybe they thought I was a goblin or something.\" Two other black players Chuck Cooper and Sweetwater Clifton also made their debuts in the 1950 season, shortly after Lloyd became the first. In 1955, the Syracuse Nationals won the NBA title, making Lloyd and teammate Jim Tucker the first black players to play for a championship team. Lloyd played a key role on the team, averaging 10.2 points and 7.7 rebounds. Lloyd was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, recognizing his contribution to the sport. His speech gave credit to his families, teachers, and coaches for their influence on his achievements. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be successful when you\u2019re surrounded by greatness,\u201d he said in Springfield. His contributions to the game extended beyond his playing days. When he joined the coaching staff of the Detroit Pistons in 1968, he became the first African-American assistant coach. He was the second African-American head coach in NBA history when he took over the Pistons in 1971. Lloyd pioneered a new era of basketball. Breaking the color barrier is a feat that will forever be remembered in NBA history.   "}

This week, we spoke with Vice President of Kings Academy &amp; Professional Development, Galen Duncan. How would you describe your role with the Sacramento Kings? My role is one that is ever changing. No two days are ever alike but primarily I look to bring a level of peace and continuity to players\u2019 lives. I hope to put them in situations that help them grow and mature. I hope to help them with the process of becoming men. Who have been your biggest role models? I have been so blessed with many role models. My father was an All-American basketball player, high school coach for 35 years and just an overall great man. My mother is a retired public school teacher who stills plays competitive basketball at the ripe age of 83. My uncle mentored me in the art of mental health. I still keep in touch with my coaches from college and high school. I also have ongoing mentorship relationships with Dr. Herb Martin and the infamous Dr. Harry Edwards. In what ways do you celebrate your African American heritage? I celebrate being black daily. I try to help players and mentees alike understand the opportunity and responsibility we have to be viewed as more than just athletes and entertainers. I try to introduce others to great inventors and creators of our past. I try to read books by black authors. I believe that African American History is American History so we should pay it as much attention as we do all other historical events. What advice would you give to fellow African Americans who are striving to succeed in the sports and entertainment industry? It\u2019s probably the same thing I would share with any minority in this business. Remember you will be judged on a different scale. Unfortunately, you will have to work harder than most. You may be denied opportunities. You may find it very unfair when you see others with less experience and less work ethic elevated by favor. However, you can never allow yourself to be shaken or not be ready for an opportunity when it presents itself. What do you enjoy most about what you do? The wins. I am not just talking about on the court (although I love those too). I love to see growth in young people. I love to see them work hard and progress into better people with better opportunities. I love to see the evolution of a player from just an athlete to a productive, conscious citizen in our community. It is a unique standpoint that not many get to witness. Why is it important to continue to encourage diversity in the workplace? Diversity in the workplace gives hope to children of all colors, races, genders and creeds. It allows people to dream. Seeing someone who looks like you in an environment gives an individual hope. I also think that it cultivates a better environment. It allows a broad range of idea expression and viewpoints. It also creates growth and learning amongst all. Hopefully, we can continue to break down these barriers and continue growing into a special environment of love and inclusion. Go Kings! "}

The site will deliver broadcast enhancements for the NBA and drive the progression of immersive media experiences in sports. Golden 1 Center is the world\u2019s most connected indoor sports and entertainment venue and will enable Intel Sports to introduce cloud based streaming volumetric video with the next generation Intel\u00ae True View platform. \u201cWe are constantly working to enhance the fan experience and it is an honor to have Golden 1 Center serve as the first Intel R&amp;D site for the NBA,\u201d said Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, chairman, CEO and owner of the Sacramento Kings. \u201cOur visions are aligned, as Intel is driving the next wave of innovative technologies and our goal in building the premier sports and entertainment venue was to be the first to convert the entire facility into a giant gaming console. The next generation of True View will allow our dedicated fans to feel like players at the center of a video game.\u201d \u201cThe Kings have built the best technology infrastructure in the league, so testing Intel True View capabilities at Golden 1 Center will accelerate the next generation of immersive media experiences for sports,\u201d said James Carwana, vice president at Intel Capital and general manager of Intel Sports. \u201cWe are proud to work with a partner so committed to improving the fan experience and exploring how to continually push the boundaries of technology to enable us to get closer to real time delivery than we previously thought possible.\u201d With the deployment of Intel True View at Golden 1 Center next season, the Sacramento Kings will be instrumental in testing the next generation of immersive, volumetric technology, and the first NBA team to debut content when the technology launches. Intel True View is transforming the highlight reel and replay experience to create awe-inspiring, 360-degree views from every vantage point. The cameras capture volumetric (height, width and depth) data of all the action and pixels with volume allow the technology to render replays in spectacular multi-perspective 3D. The information captured by the True View cameras will be available for 2020-21 NBA season on Golden 1 Center\u2019s 4K ultra HD video board and in the Kings + Golden 1 Center mobile app. The Kings have long used data and immersive video technology to augment the fan experience. Last year, the Kings announced a partnership with Imagination Park Technologies to deliver augmented reality (AR) engagement opportunities to fans, such as giveaways, scavenger hunts and in-arena photo opportunities with digital players. In 2018, the Kings became the first United States sports franchise to use Verizon's 5G technology to deliver a live, in-game, 360 virtual reality (VR) experience to fans. The Kings also streamed the NBA\u2019s first Facebook Live game broadcast to India in 2017 and became the first team to stream a game to India using VR in 2015. Intel True View will further extend the Kings commitment to using video-based technology to enhance the fan experience. Golden 1 Center opened in October 2016, is recognized as the world\u2019s most technologically advanced and sustainable arena, and was named the 2017 \u201cSports Facility of the Year\u201d by Sports Business Journal.

One of the true joys of compiling the field for the GRRSPoAT was picking out the one-off flourishes of memorable greatness served up by characters on the margins of Raptors history. The Donyell Marshalls, Ben Uzohs and Terrence Rosses of the world all stepped out of the shadows to bathe in 15 minutes of on-court fame, and they belonged in the bracket alongside the franchise greats. They were always going to be hard pressed, however, to win what was inevitably going to become something of a popularity contest. As the constitution of the fan-voted Final Four proves, star power sells.  Coming together to form the two regional final match-ups are the three players who most defined the decade-long narrative arc that led to the Raptors lifting your friend and mine, Larry O.B., last June. Kyle Lowry has guaranteed himself a spot in the tournament final by running the table over in the John Saunders Region. Meanwhile, the final bout of the Wayne Embry Region features a delicious DeMar DeRozan-Kawhi Leonard duel, the built-in tension and poetry of which I need not dive into.  The one-man committee agrees with 75 percent of the Elite Eight\u2019s voting results. It would be kind of old-hat for me to defy the people and overturn a decision I didn\u2019t agree with for a second-straight round, so the field will remain as selected. Here\u2019s how I placed my votes:    By now you\u2019re surely acquainted with the heavy-hitters in the competition, so we\u2019ll do away with an extended preamble. Let\u2019s decide who gets to play for the title of Greatest Raptors Regular Season Performance, shall we?   WAYNE EMBRY REGIONAL FINAL  (1) DeMar DeRozan scores 52p vs. Bucks - 1/1/18 vs. (10) Kawhi\u2019s 38 &amp; Game-winner vs. POR - 03/01/19    With a cozy 63-37 win over Kyle Lowry\u2019s duel with Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan continues his run of doing exactly what number one overall seeds are supposed to do. He still hasn\u2019t even been tested in the tournament.  Now standing in DeRozan\u2019s way is Leonard, who continues his two-year run of being a giant-killer in playoff tournaments wherein he\u2019s dawning Raptor colours. You could have maybe suggested Leonard benefited from the draw in round one, where he took down Walt Williams with ease. But for the last two rounds, Leonard\u2019s 38-point game against Portland last year has been the bracket-bustingest member of the field. First to fall to Raptors fans\u2019 still-lingering Leonard-induced daze was Vince Carters\u2019 48-point evening of bully-ball against the Bucks in 2000. Then, the darling of the committee, Terrence Ross and his magical 51-point night, departed us too soon at the hands of Leonard and the charmed west-end rims at Scotiabank Arena.  Clearly I have no future as a political organizer. I tried really hard to get Terrence Ross -- who if you haven\u2019t yet picked up in reading through the tournament, is one the players from Raps history whose work I most enjoyed -- through to the Final Four match-up in which he belonged. I knew the recency and star power of Leonard was going to be tough to overcome, but to hell if I wasn\u2019t going to lobby. I sent the link to family members imploring them to cast a vote in Ross\u2019 favour; I voted myself from four different devices; and as the clock ticked down, I cast aside all shame:  alright so here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Terrence Ross is trailing in the @Raptors Madness bracket right now with a few hours to go. if you go vote for him now, and send me a screenshot of your vote, I will put you into a draw to win a prize TBD if he wins. https://t.co/R77paLIqMb \u2014 Sean Woodley (@woodleysean) March 27, 2020 alright so here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Terrence Ross is trailing in the @Raptors Madness bracket right now with a few hours to go. if you go vote for him now, and send me a screenshot of your vote, I will put you into a draw to win a prize TBD if he wins. https://t.co/R77paLIqMb \u2014 Sean Woodley (@woodleysean) March 27, 2020   I received exactly one screenshot.  Leonard -- unrightfully, in my opinion -- took the victory over Ross with a 61 percent share of the vote, removing from the field one of the most surprising and joyous pops of fun a Raptor has ever produced. Thank you to the 39 percent of folks who fought for the righteous, losing cause. See my Twitter account for more Ross propaganda if that\u2019s your thing.  As for the actual Final Four match-up, DeRozan should be the heavy favourite here. His franchise-record 52 points have already proven impervious to Leonard\u2019s title run bump; the top seed knocked off Kawhi\u2019s career-best 45 points against the Jazz in the tournament\u2019s second round, surrendering only 16 percent of the vote to the region\u2019s 9-seed.  As has been the case throughout Leonard\u2019s underdog run to the Final Four, his hopes hinge on two factors: popularity, and the degree to which voters value the fortune-telling aspects of Leonard\u2019s Blazer-snuffing game-winner.      This is not, however, a tournament of the best shots, or game-winners, or single plays in Raptors history. Here we consider minutes one through 48 -- or 53 in the case of DeRozan\u2019s best game. On merit, DeRozan should pick up yet another comfortable win. Though I suppose you could have said the same about Ross two days ago.   JOHN SAUNDERS REGIONAL FINAL  (1) Lowry\u2019s 43 leads Raps past Cavs - 2/26/16 vs. (14) Lowry leads comeback vs. Mavs - 12/22/19    It\u2019s only fitting that we\u2019re guaranteed to see a Kyle Lowry Over Everything\u2122 game in the championship match-up. Now, to choose which one it\u2019ll be.  In one corner, we have what is statistically Lowry\u2019s best-ever game -- a 43-point, five-rebound, nine-assist solo undoing of the Cavaliers on a night where very few of his teammates were sharp, emphatically capped by the signature game winner of the six-time All-Star\u2019s career. In round three, he took down Vince Carter\u2019s game-changing nationwide address against Phoenix in 2000, and unlike in the Sweet Sixteen, I don\u2019t feel compelled to overturn this result.    Across the ring is another Lowry masterpiece, albeit a much lower-seeded one. Many sportstalk gasbags covering the tournament have called the Cinderella status of Lowry\u2019s comeback against the Mavs into question. Unlike Leonard, who has taken down titans, this Lowry offering is being accused of surviving an easy draw in the bracket. Each of the wins for this particular entry have been blowouts, with no margin of victory less than 77 percent to 23. You can only, however, beat who\u2019s in front of you, and as we\u2019ve learned from the Raptors over the last couple seasons, the surest sign of a good team is making easy work of your inferiors. Lowry\u2019s 30-point, nearly solo comeback against Dallas hasn\u2019t snuck through the cracks with 51-49 decisions; it\u2019s been pasting fools for three-straight rounds, and absolutely deserves Final Four status.  With all of that having been said, this is where the 14-seed loses. Awe-inspiring as the final 14 minutes of that Mavs game were, there\u2019s just too much of a gulf to overcome here if the voters are thinking with their, you know, brains. The top seed is more statistically overwhelming, and came against a fully-loaded Cavaliers team in the heat of an earnest race for first place in the East. Not that it\u2019s an excuse for choking away such a huge lead, but Dallas didn\u2019t even have Luka Doncic available on December 22nd of last year. It was a truly wonderful ride for the lowest-ranked of Lowry\u2019s three bites at the championship apple, but it\u2019ll be an argument against democracy if it progresses to Thursday\u2019s final.  If things go chalk in the Final Four, we\u2019ll get to see a battle of dear old friends -- and both number one seeds -- for the most important title in Toronto sports history.

A lot of Raptors have balled exceptionally hard over single 48 minute stretches in the last 25 years. Some of those guys -- cough, Terrence Ross -- might even be justifiably aggrieved they\u2019re not still in the title fight today. But the people have spoken. A pair of the greatest regular-season individual outings from Toronto\u2019s past have made it through four rounds of voting to stand here today. By tomorrow afternoon we\u2019ll know for certain who did in fact ball the hardest. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised by which two players earned spots in the final. There are two things about DeMar DeRozan you cannot deny: he\u2019s one of if not the most beloved players in Raps history, and his 52-point game against the Bucks absolutely ruled. Kawhi Leonard rode the wave of recency bias and latent post-title glee to the final four as a 10-seed with his 38-point dismantling of the Blazers last March, a game that of course featured a game-winner that portended other game-winners to come. But foreshadowing aside, there was no logical argument in favour of him beating out DeRozan in the Wayne Embry Regional Final. Meanwhile, with the top-two entries in the Saunders region, Kyle Lowry was guaranteed to be here. Although unlike most double-digit seed March Madness darlings, the Final Four was not too great a stage for Lowry\u2019s 14th-ranked offering. In what, by the numbers, was the biggest upset of the tournament, Lowry\u2019s afternoon of stat-stuffing and comeback-orchestrating against Dallas earlier this season toppled his career-high 43 and game-winning shot against Cleveland in February 2016; it wasn\u2019t even close, as the victor took two-thirds of the fan vote. Astonishing scenes. I won\u2019t lie. It\u2019s a bit of a disappointment to not see a duel between the tournament's two number ones. I fear a lopsided final in favour of DeRozan\u2019s top-overall seeded game where we could have seen a true heavyweight bout. But perhaps I\u2019m undercutting the punch Lowry\u2019s game against the Mavs packs, too married to the Basketball Reference Game Score metric that governed the overall seeding, the fear of bias towards the fresh and new keeping me from embracing Lowry\u2019s rousing performance that December afternoon as the truest Kyle Lowry Over Everything game of all. A razor-thin margin could very well be in the cards. Before we break down the cases further, let\u2019s take a look at the two finalists, along with the highlights of their respective finals-worthy solo performances. To help us size up the match-up, we asked Raps colour man Jack Armstrong for his two cents as well. (1) DeMar DeRozan scores franchise-record 52 vs. Milwaukee -- 01/01/18 -- 43 minutes, 52 pts, 5 rebs, 8 asts, 1 stl, 1 blk, 17/29 FGs, 5/9 3FGs, 13/13 FTs, +9, 44.1 Game Score, Raptors win 131-127 (OT)  VS. (14) Lowry scores 32-8-10, leads 30-point comeback vs. Dallas -- 12/22/19 -- 32 pts, 8 rebs, 10 ast, 1 TO, 12/23 FGs, 5/13 3FGs, 3/4 FTs, +5, 20 4th quarter points, 26.7 Game Score, Raptors win 110-107  If any part of this tournament was preordained, it was DeRozan\u2019s 52 points on the Bucks\u2019 headtops making its way through the Embry Region. Toronto\u2019s all-time leading scorer never looked better over nine years with the team than he did for the 43 minutes and 27 seconds he spent dicing up Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and friends to ring in 2018. \u201cNot only statistically, but just watching him, that was maybe his finest hour as a Raptor,\u201d Armstrong said of DeRozan\u2019s record-setting night. \u201cYou just kinda know it when you\u2019ve watched a guy a lot,\u201d he continued. There are certain nights that you look and say, \u201cthat\u2019s a better version of his normal self,\u201d he said, likening the heights above normal that DeRozan reached to what Kobe Bryant achieved the night he dropped 81 points. \u201cThe more that game went on, he just was in that proverbial zone that athletes talk about. I always joke when a guy is in that zone: Don\u2019t snap your fingers. There are certain times when you look at an athlete, and they literally are in, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a hypnotic state or whatever, but they\u2019re in that kind of out of body experience where you\u2019re like \u201cthis is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted myself to be.\u201d This was the piece de resistance on a sparkling 2017-18 resum\u00e9 for DeRozan. The season prior was all about his scoring, to the extent that he flirted with breaking records set by Michael freaking Jordan. However, after a second-straight playoff loss to the Cavs, the Culture Reset of the following season was only going to work with the buy-in of a more complete version of DeRozan. Between the triples, the assists, and the every-level scoring, that night against Milwaukee represented the apex of DeRozan\u2019s advancement into modernity, validating the Raptors\u2019 decision to stick with the core that by that point had turned 50-win seasons into child\u2019s play. They of course won 59 during DeMar\u2019s season of rebirth. DeRozan enters the final, rightfully, as the heavy favourite. If you\u2019re hoping to make a stats-based case for Lowry to pull off one last upset, you\u2019re not going to find one. Sure, he\u2019s got the rebound and assist edge over DeRozan, but that\u2019s where the advantages end. DeMar has him beat in overall scoring, efficiency from both two and three-point range, and in Game Score -- the 17.4 point difference in Basketball Reference\u2019s all-encompassing box score figure in the final is the largest we\u2019ve seen in a match-up since the tournament\u2019s opening round. DeRozan\u2019s got the numbers argument locked down. Lowry\u2019s hopes hinge on the degree to which the voters are in touch with the more whimsical elements of basketball. A vote for this Lowry game is a vote for the very concept of Kyle Lowry, where numbers are always secondary to his maniacal genius. It\u2019s also an acknowledgement of every other game Lowry\u2019s taken over in the way only he can, a list far longer than the three that made it into the bracket. A 32-game bracket of only classic Lowry performances would be damn compelling theatre on its own. You can sense the tonal shift that hits when Lowry decides a game is his and his alone. Sometimes a bear-poking is the inciting incident, others it\u2019s his innate sense for what his team needs that sees him arrest control and hunt buckets. Regardless of how it happens, the momentum of a signature KLOE game cannot be restrained. The Mavs know this well. \u201cIt was a pretty cool experience to watch,\u201d said Armstrong, who was watching the Raptors comeback as a spectator that day, with Sportsnet on dual radio and TV duty. \u201cI just think he was playing like a whirling dervish. Just driving the ball with great intensity, getting to the rim, shooting the ball with confidence, making plays for teammates \u2026 he led the way, but I think he started feeding off of teammates as well. I just think it defines him, he\u2019s one of those guys that just has a remarkable competitive spirit and juice and passion about how he plays, where there\u2019s just no let up.\u201d \u201cWhen you looked at the deficit -- it was improbable, almost impossible,\u201d Armstrong added. \u201cWhen Kyle Lowry looks back on his career in Toronto and reflects on certain games and certain moments, I\u2019m sure that will be right, right, right at the top of the list.\u201d Another argument in Lowry\u2019s favour is borne out of the circumstances under which the game with Dallas was played. Toronto was just days removed from losing Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell and Marc Gasol in the same game down the road in Detroit. Against the Mavs, the shuffled up starters around Lowry struggled. OG Anunoby, Serge Ibaka, Patrick McCaw and Fred VanVleet combined to shoot 11-of-38, with only VanVleet breaking double figures. It wasn\u2019t until Terence Davis II, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Malcolm Miller and Chris Boucher joined Lowry in a chaotic full-court press that the Raptors put a comeback on the table. Making it work with anybody is Lowry\u2019s M.O., maybe never more so than during the month or so he spent as the team\u2019s undisputed number one option this season around the turn of the calendar. \u201cHe was absolutely remarkable in that stretch,: said Armstrong, who did the TV call for Toronto\u2019s next game, a back-to-back in Indy that Lowry nearly won on his own in OT. \u201cAnd obviously he\u2019s been remarkable this season. He looks like a guy that\u2019s completely unburdened from the pressure now of legacy, and title and all that -- he\u2019s playing free and easy and being that guy that\u2019s completely fearless and coming at you, taking on all comers and making plays left, right and centre. And in that game -- that\u2019s a game that on most days in professional basketball ... that you look and you say, \u201ccome on, you know, really let\u2019s get ready for the game tomorrow.\u201d Instead of welcoming the sweet release of garbage time, Lowry turned in one of the most masterful quarters of his career, earning himself a spot in the final, and as revealed by Armstrong via email, the vote of the Raptors\u2019 long-time colour voice. Lowry and DeRozan are the support beams upon which the most successful era of Raptors hoops was built. Their best evenings meant different things, microcosms of each player\u2019s story at distinct times in their personal arcs. DeRozan\u2019s got the numbers case. Lowry\u2019s holding down the intangibles. And you, the voters, have the final say. Be sure to vote for who you think should be named the GRRSPoAT Champion at the link provided.       "}

Welcome to the Elite Eight of the Greatest Raptors Regular Season Performances of All-Time Tournament -- the GRRSPoAT for short of course. This past weekend, a field of 16 was chopped in half to create the regional semifinal match-ups before you today. And as was the case in the opening round, while there were some disagreements between your one-man committee and the will of the people, most of the results made some amount of the sense. Note the keyword: most. Here were my personal choices, and the voting splits at the time I made my picks.Only the result of the Ibaka-Bosh tilt in Saunders region flipped by the time voting closed. Seven of the eight remaining single-game efforts by some of your most beloved Raptors legends are still alive today because you chose them to be. There was, however, one ugly duckling in the second-round voting process that could not go unchecked. In the 4 vs. 12 match-up between Vince Carter\u2019s 51-point explosion on NBC -- the franchise\u2019s true arrival on the national stage -- and Kawhi Leonard\u2019s 37 points in a winning effort over the Warriors and a fire-spewing Kevin Durant, something went wrong. Leonard\u2019s game was awesome, that I am not here to deny. But there is no way it was awesome enough to best Carter with a 60-40 share of the vote. It\u2019s with an extreme dose of not-mad disappointment that I must declare the 60 percent of folks who voted for Kawhi to be objectively wrong. Look, I get it. We\u2019re all cooped up inside, socially distancing like good citizens should. But being responsible comes at a price. Confinement can throw you for a loop, and that loop can result in the erroneous selection of what was a great-not-transcendent Leonard game over one of the most iconic games in Raps history. Recency bias is a scourge. So it\u2019s with deep understanding that everyone\u2019s going through it a little bit right now that I\u2019ve made the executive decision to advance Carter to the Elite Eight, and send the Kawhi game packing. It did not feel right to have a final eight in a bracket about Raptors doing incredible things without a single entry from the guy whose DNA was literally said to be 50 percent comprised of Amazing. With that slightly problematic exertion of emergency powers out of the way, we enter the regional semis with six different guys in contention for the crown. All three of Kyle Lowry\u2019s entries cruised through the Sweet Sixteen with no margin of victory less than 60-40. He\u2019s joined by one-off appearances by DeMar DeRozan, Terrence Ross, Leonard, Carter, and Serge Ibaka. Both two seeds met their end in the second round, while three double-digit seeds are still kicking -- one of which is guaranteed passage to the Final Four. Let\u2019s run through today\u2019s four match-ups. WAYNE EMBRY REGIONAL SEMIFINALS (1) DeMar DeRozan scores 52p vs. Bucks - 1/1/18 vs. (4) Kyle Lowry duels Steph Curry - 12/5/15 As I detailed ahead of the first round, I seeded each game in the field according to Basketball Reference\u2019s Game Score metric. I didn\u2019t sow seeds of high stakes drama with strategic early-round placements. Though I wouldn\u2019t blame you if I thought I did with the first of our regional semis. Here you have two best pals, their basketball lives and legacies already intertwined forever, in their second head-to-head match-up in the Embry Region in as many rounds. DeRozan\u2019s top-seeded career night rides high into the Elite Eight after scoring the most lopsided victory of the second round -- an 84-16 demolition of Leonard\u2019s 45-point game against the Jazz last year. But how comfortable can DeRozan really be feeling right now, after his 42-point punking of Jimmy Butler\u2019s Bulls fell in a 62-38 decision to his old backcourt buddy\u2019s 41-point duel with Steph Curry back in 2015? DeMar\u2019s case to move on is formed out of concrete fact. Per Basketball Reference, no Raptor has ever put up a more prolific box score than DeRozan did against the Bucks that New Year\u2019s Day. To shoot 17-of-29, including 5-of-9 from three, against a Bucks team boasting a burgeoning Giannis Antetokounmpo next to Khris Middleton on the wings is no small feat. This was DeRozan at the height of his playmaking powers -- an all-encompassing performance that validated the Raptors\u2019 adoption of the vaunted \u201cCulture Reset\u201d offense. This wasn\u2019t an evening of hero ball, but that doesn\u2019t mean DeRozan\u2019s efforts were anything short of heroic. Lowry\u2019s hopes, meanwhile, hinge on outside factors a little more. How much will it weigh on the minds of voters that the Raptors lost that game against the undefeated Warriors? Does it matter that Steph Curry\u2019s 44-point night was several orders of magnitude better than what the best members of the Bucks could muster in DeRozan\u2019s best game? How do you account for the fact that Lowry essentially kept the Raptors in the game that December night on his own? It\u2019s worth noting that Lucas Nogueira (14-4-3 on 7-of-9) was decidedly the second-best Raptor that night. DeRozan\u2019s record-setting night is probably in the driver\u2019s seat here. But unlike in the next match-up, there is no wrong answer. (3) T-Ross\u2019 51-points - 01/25/14 vs. (10) Kawhi\u2019s 38 &amp; Game-winner vs. POR - 03/01/19 You guys sure made Terrence Ross\u2019 loyal follower(s) sweat. Pitted against Pascal Siakam\u2019s 44-point game from earlier this season, Ross\u2019 evening of most splendid bucketry barely pulled out the round two win, earning 53 percent of the vote -- tied for the closest Sweet Sixteen duel. Across the aisle is Leonard, who managed a 10-over-2 upset of Vince Carter\u2019s brutish 48-point night against the Bucks in November 2000. That result makes a little more sense than the overturned Kawhi-over-Vince decision. Even with 10 fewer points on Leonard\u2019s ledger, the predictive elements of his first multi-bounce game-winner from the right corner understandably add a lot of juice to his lone-remaining tournament entry. Of the four match-ups we\u2019re discussing today, this is the one that would make for the most riveting one-on-one game. Ross, in the same unconscious form he assumed on his 51-point night, might have been just brazen enough to defy Leonard\u2019s immense defensive gifts. You can\u2019t pick-pocket the ball if it\u2019s being hoisted from 30 feet directly into your eyeball -- just ask Willie Green.  Leonard\u2019s demolition of the Blazers was remarkable, yes. But the issue with his case against Ross\u2019 most outstanding night is how little his 38-3-5 against Portland stands out against the backdrop of his season in Toronto. He consistently excelled to the point that each of the 22 games in which he scored 30-plus kind of run together in the mind. Before some truly transcendent stuff out of Leonard in the postseason, last year was more or less a blur of superstardom, one methodical evening of taking names bleeding into the next. Leonard has his playoff glory and his Finals MVP. He\u2019s got his back-breaking offensive rebounds,\u00a0 the fourth quarter of Game 5 in Milwaukee, and two landmark shots over Joel Embiid. He even said the quiet part loud; the 2018-19 season was all about the playoffs, and that mindset paid off lavishly. Leonard surely won\u2019t recall any of his stuffed regular-season stat lines compared to what he did in the spring. Ross, meanwhile, reached his career pinnacle the night he canned 51. Give this one to the guy who not only deserves it, but will appreciate it most. Ross belongs in the Final Four.  JOHN SAUNDERS REGIONAL SEMIFINALS (1) Lowry\u2019s 43 leads Raps past Cavs - 2/26/16 vs. *(4) Vince scores 51 on National TV - 2/27/00 What on earth do you even do with this one? In the first Saunders Region semi, we have the two pillars of the two most successful eras in Raptors history, on arguably their best individual nights as pros. Lowry made quick work of Siakam\u2019s 44-point night against Washington last season, with a 64 percent share of the voting. Vince is here because I said so. What an absurd Lowry game this one was. With more hype that had ever been attached to a Raps regular-season game, and a legitimate and important race for the top seed very much hanging over the proceedings, Lowry delivered like it was a Finals-clinching game in Oakland. Before the specter of the Cavs came to haunt the Raps and their fans in later years, this was a game that offered hope that maybe LeBron James and friends could be bested -- all they needed was 43 points, five boards and nine assists on a hilarious 15-of-20 shooting from their point guard to do it. This was a game that put the demons of the 2015 playoffs firmly in the rearview, and hinted at the Conference Finals potential that year\u2019s team would eventually come to realize. With a dude this cold-blooded at the reigns, the Raptors could talk themselves into having a shot against anyone:  As deserved as Lowry is of the top seed in the region, there\u2019s a chance this could also be the first L he\u2019s handed in the tournament. Vince\u2019s 51 capped off a transformative month for the Raptors franchise, wherein a team of young studs and sage vets stuck in northern anonymity became mainstream darlings. Of course Carter and Tracy McGrady owning the dunk contest got that ball rolling, but Vince taking the deed to Jason Kidd\u2019s Suns made the Raptors\u2019 momentum unstoppable. Flip a coin once, twice, a hundred times -- this is the closest third-round match-up we\u2019ve got. (14) Lowry leads comeback vs. Mavs - 12/22/19 vs. (10) Serge scores 34 &amp; 10 @ LAL - 11/4/18 Is that the merry band of dress-crafting mice from Cinderella I hear singing? Our final Elite Eight match-up sees two lower-seeded upstarts square off, though their roads through round two were quite different. Despite being the lowest remaining seed, Lowry\u2019s team-carrying effort against Dallas from earlier this year crushed the career night OG Anunoby put together two years ago on March 1st, 2020. Only DeRozan\u2019s margin of victory topped Lowry\u2019s 77 percent share of the vote. This is no ordinary 14-seed. Ibaka on the other hand, took down an all-time Chris Bosh game in a narrow 53-47 vote to continue his upset trail through the bracket. Though the seeding suggests Ibaka enters the regional semi as a favourite, Vegas would probably take Lowry to move on if Vegas were invested in such things. Considering the dearth of other sports going on, perhaps they should be. Ibaka\u2019s up against the brilliance of Lowry on two different fronts here. Not only was the Lowry-engineered 30-point comeback against Dallas the kind of thing that makes brick walls quiver in fear, but there\u2019s a good case to be made that Ibaka\u2019s career-best night does not happen without Lowry doing his Lowry thing. Ibaka was a dead-eye triggerman that night in LA; 15-of-17 lines don\u2019t come easy, and Ibaka was lethally accurate no matter the means by which he received the ball. Per NBA.com\u2019s pass-tracking stats, though, seven of Ibaka\u2019s field goals that night were assisted by Lowry. If the \u201cindividual\u201d element of the individual performances bracket matters a lot to you, then it\u2019s going to be tough to cast a vote for Ibaka. That\u2019s especially true when you consider just how Herculean Lowry\u2019s exploits against the Mavs were. He scored 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in the final frame that December afternoon, chipping in two assists, and making the scarcely-used four-man supporting cast of Malcolm Miller, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Terence Davis and Chris Boucher sing. This was individuality in its purest form. Factoring the voting bump that recency has provided in the tournament thus far, Lowry\u2019s lowest-seeded entry into the tournament isn\u2019t just a threat to advance to the Final Four. It just might win the whole damn thing. Be sure to vote at the links provided, and check back on Saturday as we tee up the Final Four.       "}

Welcome back to the only tournament worth caring about this March, as we carry on determining which single-game, regular season performance in Raptors history is in fact the best. The first round saw its share of upsets. Seven lower-seeds pulled off victories in the fan vote, with only one chalk match-up on tap for the Sweet Sixteen. With that having been said, it\u2019s worth noting the vote disparity in most of the opening round tilts. Only a single first-round match-up -- Vince Carters\u2019 47-point game against the Bucks (43%) vs. DeMar DeRozan\u2019s 42-point, Bull Curse-breaking outing -- had a final tally closer than 60-40. We also said goodbye to most of the one-off entries into the field. Mike James, Charlie Villanueva, Andrea Bargnani, Morris Peterson, Keon Clark, Damon Stoudamire, Lou Williams, Marcus Camby, Amir Johnson, Walt Williams, Ben Uzoh, PJ Tucker, Donyell Marshall and Jos\u00e9 Calderon all had their hopes of a title dashed quickly and decisively. A field of 23 unique contestants has been cruelly shaved down to just nine, with the franchise\u2019s most beloved stars hanging on to most of the remaining entries. Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have the most balls left in the hopper, both having won all three of their Round of 32 match-ups, followed by DeRozan, Carter and Pascal Siakam with two each. Terrence Ross, OG Anunoby, Serge Ibaka and Chris Bosh occupy the four remaining spots. I\u2019m not here to scold anyone. And outside of openly lobbying for Ross\u2019 51-point game to win the whole thing I\u2019m not here to influence the vote, but I will use this space to say one thing: there were some severely wronged parties in the opening rounds. Here\u2019s a look at my first-round picks, and the scores at the time of said selections, which did not appreciably change by the time voting closed. 16.jpg   Williams, Camby and Stoudamire were always at risk of being doomed by the 20-something years between their exploits and the construction of the bracket. But Clark, Charlie V and even Carter\u2019s dominant 47-pointer against Milwaukee all received unfair shakes in the eyes of the committee. No, those games didn\u2019t happen during the We The North era, but the highlight videos are all readily available for diligent voters to peruse. Alas, I invited myself into the fan-voted bed, and so here I will lay. As we outlined in the piece covering the Round of 32, there were no bad games in the running. There were always bound to be some disagreements, and the 16 remaining contenders all had compelling cases to make it this far. Old man lecture over; let\u2019s get to it.  THE WAYNE EMBRY REGION (VOTE NOW) (1) DeMar DeRozan scores 52p vs. Bucks - 1/1/18 vs. (8) Kawhi Leonard scores 45 vs. Utah vs. - 1/1/19 It was smooth sailing for the top-overall seed in round one, as DeRozan\u2019s franchise-record night cruised past Ben Uzoh with 98 percent of the vote. Leonard meanwhile crushed Camby by an 80-20 split. DeRozan\u2019s claim to an Elite Eight spot is pretty iron-clad. His 52-point night punctuated his best season as a Raptor, the highest peak in a vast range. 2017-18 was of course the season that saw DeRozan jack up a career-high number of threes per game, while connecting on 31 percent, the second highest percentage he\u2019s produced. He also reached previously uncharted play-making heights that year, dishing a then-personal best 5.2 dimes a night. Those steps helped modernize his game, without detracting from his masterful footwork, mid-range artistry, and around-the-rim scoring touch. That night against Milwaukee, each disparate element of DeRozan\u2019s tool bag congealed, turning not only DeRozan into a walking bucket, but each of his teammates around him, too. Leonard\u2019s night of silencing the Jazz wasn\u2019t so much a clinic in well-roundedness, but rather a frightening bit of proof that his injuries had healed, and was ready to carry an offense. He only picked up a single assist on the night of his career-high scoring output. But I mean, who needs to pass when you can walk into a 16-of-22 shooting line? This was the game that alerted the league to Leonard\u2019s lofty, best-in-the-world ambitions.  (4) Kyle Lowry duels Steph Curry - 12/5/15 vs. (12)\u00a0 DeMar ends Bulls streak w/ 42-7-8 - 3/21/17 Here we get our first match-up between two of the best buds these parts have ever seen. A Raps loss in Lowry\u2019s 41-point duel with Steph Curry wasn\u2019t enough to dissuade voters from handing him a 75 percent share of the votes against Amir Johnson, who deserved better. DeRozan\u2019s 12-over-5 upset of Vince Carter\u2019s Olympic-snub revenge game against Ray Allen\u2019s Bucks was the closest of the opening round, but still comfortable. Choosing a winner here probably comes down to how much voters value wins or losses in big time regular season games. Efficiency-wise, Lowry has the edge here. He scored his 41 in that narrow loss to Golden State on a moist 14-of-26, knocking down 60 percent of his threes. He was also by far the best player on his team that night; DeRozan shot a poor 5-of-19, with Lowry outscoring the rest of the Raptors\u2019 starting five on his own. DeRozan got the win, though. Sure, he was sub-50 percent from the floor (17-of-38), and was helped by some steady complementary efforts by the likes of Cory Joseph, Serge Ibaka (before he tried to punch Robin Lopez and got tossed) and PJ Tucker, but it was still DeRozan who took over in crunch time and OT in domineering fashion. Extra bonus points go DeRozan\u2019s way for besting long-time Raps killer Jimmy Butler, as well as ending a years-long hex the Bulls had cast over Toronto. Call this one a toss-up. There\u2019s a real chance we see a DeRozan vs. DeRozan match-up in the Elite Eight. (3) T-Ross\u2019 51-points - 01/25/14 vs. (11) Pascal\u2019s 44-10-4\u00a0 in New Orleans - 11/8/1 Welcome to the third match-up of the second round, brought to you by the song \u201cSmooth\u201d by Carlos Santana featuring Rob Thomas. No second-round tilt features two individual scoring bursts that were so effortless. Ross, a winner by a 72-28 split of the vote over Chris Bosh, enters as the favourite against Siakam, whose all-encompassing 44-point outburst earlier this season proved too much for Donyell Marshall\u2019s most exquisite display of catch-and-shoot bombing. Career-bests usually don\u2019t come easy; both Ross and Siakam surely disagree. Upon re-watching, these performances are startling in their similarity. In both cases, the victimized parties seemed utterly hopeless to stop Ross and Siakam from doing very mean things to them. New Orleans threw just about every defender in their cache against the Raptors\u2019 All-Star, none of which had a clue where to start. Ross meanwhile left JJ Redick, Jamal Crawford, Jared Dudley and their other ill-equipped pals both in his dust, and in awe. Both scoring outputs were earned at all three levels. Ross was well-known for his super-easy three-point stroke (probably the nicest in Raps history non-Matt Thomas division) by the time he lit up the Clips; this was one of the first inklings that Siakam\u2019s might be devastating, too. Even the shooting lines -- 16-of-29 for Ross, 17-of-28 for Siakam -- are in almost dead heat. This is where I disclose that there\u2019s a framed Terrence Ross photo hanging above the very desk at which this is being written. With that, here\u2019s the video of Ross\u2019 51-point night:  For the life of me I couldn\u2019t find the video of Siakam\u2019s game. Crazy, I know. (2) Vince scores 48 vs. Bucks - 11/18/00 vs. (10) Kawhi\u2019s 38 &amp; Game-winner vs. POR - 03/01/19 In a bit of a surprise, only one of Carters\u2019 40-burgers against Milwaukee advanced beyond round one. It happened in resounding fashion, as Carter bested Mighty Mouse\u2019s heroics against MJ\u2019s Bulls in an 81-19 landslide. Sadly for Walt Williams, he never stood much of a chance against the first of Kawhi\u2019s two multi-bounce game-winners as a Raptor. While Carter\u2019s second punking of Milwaukee in a calendar year lacked the windmilling pizzazz and aggrieved, Olympic-inspired fury by which Carter was fueled eleven months earlier, his 48-pointer in November 2000 goes down as one of the more punishing games Carter ever played. He bullied the Bucks on the glass for ten boards, including five on the offensive end. A 14-of-31 shooting mark was evened out by his 18 trips to the line, 17 of which were successful. Carter made his name on grace and finesse, but he might just bruise his way to a chip in this tournament. Leonard on the other hand, is and always has been a straight-up beefcastle. His baskets often leave a wake of deflected defenders, their torsos black and blue having been parried away by Leonard\u2019s bulbous shoulders. Portland was no exception on March 1st of last year. Though if there\u2019s a knock on the second of three remaining Kawhi entries, it\u2019s that aside from the game-winning shot, his line of 38-3-5 on 14-of-22 shooting looks rather normal compared to so many of his other box score lines from last season.  THE JOHN SAUNDERS REGION (VOTE NOW) (1) Lowry\u2019s 43 leads Raps past Cavs - 2/26/16 vs. (9) Siakam\u2019s 44-10-2 vs Wizards - 2/13/19 Like on the other side of the bracket, the top-seed in the Saunders region coasted by with a 98 percent share of the fan vote, and rightfully so. PJ Tucker\u2019s Raps re-debut was memorable and awesome, but he was essentially a D-3 school taking on a top-seeded Kentucky (or I guess Villanova?) in the matchup with Lowry\u2019s career night. Coming in off a runaway 90-10 upset in the 8-9 matchup is Siakam, who\u2019s up against long odds in his bid to pull out a second-straight upset. Where this match-up is likely to be decided is in the heft of the games in which both Lowry and Siakam set their career-best scoring marks. Siakam was undeniably brilliant against the Wizards, filling in as the top option as Kawhi Leonard rested up for the postseason run that was later to come, and giving all sorts of reasons to buy into his future as a go-to guy. It was against a lottery-bound Wizards team, though. Lowry\u2019s masterclass was conducted against the Raptors\u2019 boogeyman, LeBron James, in what was absolutely the biggest game of the 2015-16 Raptors season, and maybe the weightiest non-playoff game the team had ever contested. This feels like another chalk victory for Lowry, who may be the most likely of the three guys with three remaining entries to stay clean into the Elite Eight. (4) Vince scores 51 on National TV - 2/27/00 vs. (12) Kawhi scores 37 in OT duel with KD - 11/29/18 Leonard\u2019s station in this tournament is certainly threatened. He enters all three of his second-round match-ups -- two of which are against Vince -- as the betting underdog. You wouldn\u2019t even be crazy to suggest that two of his foes, the top-seeded DeRozan game and this one right here, are among the three or four most likely single-game efforts to win the whole shebang. Here we see two all-time nationally televised explosions from Raps history square off. Carter\u2019s, as detailed in the breakdown of his first-round match-up with Jos\u00e9 Calderon, was the game that perhaps more than any other put Toronto on the basketball map. For a guy on a Canadian team to be a perennial All-Star vote chart-topper is a feat that should not be slept on. Vince\u2019s 51-point, nine-rebound slapping of a very good Suns team was \u201cThe Carter Effect\u201d condensed into 48 minutes.  It remains to be seen, the far-reaching implications of Kawhi\u2019s lone, title-winning season in Toronto. But based on the fervour with which the nation leapt onto the basketball hype train last season, there\u2019s a good chance that in 15 to 20 years we\u2019ll be talking about \u201cThe Leonard Effect\u201d as well. On a late November night, with TNT\u2019s crew on the call, and the Warriors in the house, we witnessed one of the early sparks that would set Canadian hoops ablaze. Leonard\u2019s 37 points didn\u2019t necessarily go shot-for-shot with Kevin Durant that night, but he wasn\u2019t far off. Carter came with no caveats that night in February, 2000. He should score a close victory here. (6) OG\u2019s 32 with seven steals @ DEN - 03/01/20 vs.\u00a0 (14) Lowry leads comeback vs. Mavs - 12/22/19 Recency bias, as we learned in the opening round of voting, can often colour our perceptions with a heavy-handed tint. However, neither of the two most recently compiled box scores in this tournament can be accused of benefiting from it. Both of these games ruled, and were deserving of safe passage into round two. Anunoby pasted Lou Williams with 82 percent of the vote, while Lowry\u2019s 86-14 demolition of Andrea Bargnani\u2019s audition for the Knicks powers him through as the lowest remaining seed. The same factor that might cost Lowry in his duel with DeMar DeRozan over in the Embry region could very well lift him over his beloved Anunoby here. As tantalizing as Anunoby\u2019s pass-stealing, dunk-yamming, Jokic-annoying 32-7-3-7 effort against Denver was, the fact remains that the Raptors lost the game 133-118.  Lowry\u2019s 32 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists against Dallas don\u2019t represent some unheard of stat accrual for the six-time All-Star, but the circumstances under which he did such damage elevated those numbers like salt and pepper on lamb brains. He tested the limits of what \u201cLowry plus four guys\u201d lineups can do. He erased a 30-point deficit by sheer force of will. If the end result doesn\u2019t matter, OG\u2019s game stands a chance. If it does, the tournament\u2019s Cinderella story should stay alive. (2) Bosh scores 40-5-5 vs. Dwight\u2019s Magic - 2/20/08 vs. (10) Serge scores 34 &amp; 10 @ LAL - 11/4/18 Closing out the second round we have one of the more intriguing match-ups, if not one of the super high stakes ones. This feels like a little two fun mid-majors meeting in round two, knowing it\u2019s all gravy that both advanced past opening day. Bosh of course is no slouch as a two seed, though his 64 percent share of the vote against Keon Clark\u2019s 12-block game was the third-narrowest margin of victory for any of the Sweet Sixteen\u2019s contestants. Frankly, I think Clark was robbed. But that\u2019s fine. Ibaka pulled the upset over the seven-seed Mike James, getting four fifths of the vote; a shockingly easy cakewalk for Ma Fuzzy Chef. What makes this match-up fun is the parallels between Bosh and Ibaka\u2019s playing styles, and the ways in which they were implemented in their respective big time nights. Both were mid-range marksmen, both were incredibly efficient (96% True Shooting for Bosh, 93 for Ibaka), and both helped lift the Raptors over nemeses that had haunted them in the past. This feels like Bosh\u2019s match-up to lose, but do not underestimate the \u201cHow Bored Are You?\u201d bump. gettyimages-1057529674.jpg   Be sure to vote for who you think should advance to the Elite Eight at the links provided, and check back next Thursday as we move one step closer to The Final Four.

With a championship in 2019 and a deeply satisfying 64-game title defense clouding people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s easy to get hung up on recency bias when discussing the greatest moments, games and performances the franchise has produced. Of course, this is a franchise now with a quarter century\u2019s worth of dry ink in its history book, and though not every year has been a rousing, 50-win success, there have been plenty of moments of brilliance doled out by the 236 players to have worn Raps colours. Because this particular week of the calendar brings with it a thirst for bracketized sports that will not this year be quenched, we thought it might be worth trying to decide which of those moments -- and more specifically, which single-game individual performance -- should hold the title as the greatest in Raptors history, using a fan-voted, knockout-style tournament as the arbiter. Toronto has contested 1,984 games since joining the league in 1995, with anywhere between seven and 13 players hitting the floor for each and every one. Here, we\u2019ve managed to whittle it down to the 32 box score lines that shine the brightest to this day. Only a couple of rules applied in building the tournament field. Playoff games were excluded, so as to create some unpredictability -- a necessary measure to avoid a stroll to the championship for Kyle Lowry\u2019s Finals-clinching Game 6 performance. To ensure a diverse bracket, the number of entries per player was capped at three. Don\u2019t yell at me -- or anyone, for that matter -- about the seeding; that part of the process was done objectively, based on Basketball Reference\u2019s Game Score metric, which gives every player\u2019s box score from every game an overall figure to gauge how awesome it was. DeMar DeRozan\u2019s franchise record-setting 52-point game against the Bucks on New Years\u2019 Day 2018 comes in as the clear top-overall seed, with a Game Score of 44.1. This is not, however, a compilation of the 32-highest Game Scores in Raps history. That wouldn\u2019t be fun. Certain factors, both ethereal and quantitative, came into play in constructing the bracket as well. Did a huge performance result in a victory for the Raptors? What was the quality of the opponent? Were there memorable plays, moments or post-game quotes associated with a game of note? Without those distinguishing features, the many, many games where Vince Carter scored 40-plus kind of run together. Lastly, a word to the snubs. The committee (of one) had some tough calls to make when it came to the bottom portions of the bracket. Could the field have been expanded to 64? Maybe, but not without seriously diluting the overall oomph of the match-ups. Of course, that means some very worthy single-game efforts have been left off, including but not limited to: Bismack Biyombo\u2019s 25-rebound game against Pacers in 2015-2016, Jonas Valanciunas\u2019 32-point, 11-rebound season-opener the following year, and half-dozen signature Kyle Lowry games. Doug Christie might have the most legit beef with the committee, as his near quadruple-double (29 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and eight steals) in April 1997 just missed the cut.  Let\u2019s get to know the contestants. And be sure to vote on who you think should win each match-up. THE WAYNE EMBRY REGION (VOTE NOW) (1) DeMar DeRozan scores 52p vs. Bucks - 1/1/18 vs. (16) The Ben Uzoh Triple-Double - 4/26/12 DeMar DeRozan rightfully holds the top-overall seed here. His franchise record 52 points represented the high-point of his best season as a pro. It\u2019ll go down as one of the most modernized showings of DeRozan\u2019s career, too, as he did his damage on 17-of-29 shooting, including 5-of-9 from three, adding in five boards, eight assists, and a perfect 13-of-13 mark from the line. Nine of his 52 came in overtime, as he pushed the Raps over the line to win 131-127, and onward to a 25-10 start to the season. The upstart 16-seed here is Ben Uzoh. Only seven players in franchise history have recorded a triple-double, with Uzoh\u2019s coming in as by far the unlikeliest. If you believe in the Butterfly Effect, it\u2019s one of the most important, too. Uzoh\u2019s 12 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in the 2011-12 season finale against the Nets earned the team its 23rd win of that lockout-shortened season, in the process dropping Toronto from sixth in the draft lottery odds down to eighth, behind the Blazers (via New Jersey) and Warriors. Damian Lillard went sixth-overall in the 2012 draft, followed by Harrison Barnes before the Raptors snagged Terrence Ross. Had they lost The Uzoh Game, chosen sixth, and taken Lillard, there\u2019s a good chance Kyle Lowry never finds himself traded to Toronto that summer. There\u2019d also be a very different, much less fun three-seed in the Wayne Embry Region. Thank you, Ben. (8) Kawhi Leonard scores 45 vs. Utah - 01/01/19 vs. (9) Marcus Camby\u2019s 36-9-3-2-4 vs Philly - 03/18/97 Kawhi Leonard wowed Raps fans so consistently over the 60 regular season games he played in Toronto that it\u2019s tough to distinguish between games where he was great and merely very good. However, on the one-year anniversary of DeRozan\u2019s 52-point outburst, Leonard diced up the Jazz with as much precision as he\u2019d ever show in Toronto, scoring 45 points on 16-of-22 shooting, going 13-of-17 from the line in a 122-116 Raptors win. Marcus Camby stuffed plenty of box scores during his two years in Toronto, but never quite like he did on March 18th, 1997 against the Sixers. The 33.9 Game Score he compiled is five points clear of his next most prolific game as a Raptor. (5) Vince scores 47 on the Bucks - 1/14/00 vs. (12) DeMar ends Bulls streak w/ 42-7-8 - 3/21/17 Here Vince Carter makes his first appearance in the tournament, though not his highest-ranked one. This game was already discussed in a piece earlier this month, but here are the details: 47 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks on 20-of-32 from the field. His final two buckets were a self-pass, off-backboard, two-handed jam and a ferocious windmill -- an amuse bouche for the dunk contest to come in a few weeks\u2019 time. DeRozan\u2019s second entry into the tournament wasn\u2019t as prolific or efficient as his top-seeded offering, but the context of his 42-point, seven-rebound, eight-assist effort against Chicago matters. This was the game that finally ended an 11-game losing streak to the Bulls, and came during the stretch of 2016-17 in which Lowry was sidelined with a wrist injury -- a period in which DeRozan was sublime. When you also consider the sheer volume of absurd plays DeRozan pulled off in the fourth quarter and overtime as Toronto erased a double-digit deficit, it\u2019s easy to overlook a 17-of-38 shooting line.  (4) Kyle Lowry duels Steph Curry - 12/5/15 vs. (13) Amir Johnson\u2019s 32 &amp; 10 @ Lakers - 12/8/13 Kyle Lowry\u2019s been a pain in the Warriors\u2019 side since long before he scored the first 11 points of the Finals-clinching game last June. Back during the early days of the 2015-16 season, Lowry served up one of the closest calls Steph Curry and the Warriors would dodge on their road to starting the season a record 24-0. Coming to Toronto at 20-0, the Warriors barely squeaked out a 112-109 victory, with Lowry\u2019s 41 points and seven dimes on 14-of-26 shooting lining up toe-to-toe with the future two-time MVP\u2019s 44 points on 14-of-24. This game was impossibly cool.  The underdog in this tilt is a stout one. On the day Rudy Gay was traded to Sacramento in 2013, the Raptors visited Staples Center with just eight available players on hand. DeRozan and Lowry were great, combining for 49 points, but it was Amir Johnson who stole the spotlight in his hometown, posting a career-high 32 points and grabbing 10 boards on a near-perfect 14-of-17 line from the floor. You could argue that very win set the Raptors on the trajectory they\u2019re still riding today. (6) Donyell Marshall hits 12 threes - 03/13/05 vs. (11) Pascal\u2019s 44-10-4\u00a0 in New Orleans - 11/8/19 Our 6-seed in the Wayne Embry Region needs no introduction nor any contextualizing caveats. Donyell Marshall hit 12 freaking threes in a game one time, and it ruled.  Coming in to take on Marshall is Pascal Siakam\u2019s 44-point, 10-rebound effort from earlier this season on the night that saw both Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka leave the game in New Orleans with injuries. Looking back, that night answered the question of how the 2019-20 Raptors would cope with injuries. The answer: quite well. (3) T-Ross\u2019 51-points - 01/25/14 vs. (14) Bosh scores 37-14-5 in Mo-Pete Miracle Game - 3/30/07 What defines a great individual performance? It\u2019s a complex elixir. Prolificacy matters, of course -- racking up buckets helps you stand out. The ease and grace with which those points are accrued has to be considered as well. There\u2019s beauty in having to work for it, but a greater level of amazement is reserved for those who can make the improbable seem casual. And while some may suggest the end result skewing your team\u2019s way is essential, one could argue a truly great performance transcends the final score to the point it becomes secondary bar trivia fodder. Terrence Ross\u2019 51-point game against the Lob City era Clippers included each of those features and more. Few times in Raps history has a player ever looked as smooth. That game also still holds the record (tied with Carter) as the highest-scoring total by a Raptor in a game decided in regulation. People forget that. Taking on this juggernaut is Chris Bosh, who was the underwritten story of one of the more fun Raps games in history. March 30th, 2007 is known mainly for Morris Peterson\u2019s Michael Ruffin-assisted miracle three at the buzzer to force overtime. That shot is deservedly the landmark moment of that game, but Bosh deserves some love for his contributions to the 123-118 OT win. His game-high 37 came on 15-of-24 shooting, and opened up the stage upon which Mo-Pete could have his defining Raptors moment. (7) Walt Williams\u2019 33-12-6-2-4 vs Suns - 2/1/97 vs. (10) Kawhi\u2019s 38 &amp; Game-winner vs. POR - 1/1/19 With the youthful star power of Damon Stoudamire and Marcus Camby taking up most of the airspace for the fledgling Raps of the mid-90s, Walt Williams is a bit of a forgotten man when discussing the early pillars of the organization. Williams certainly was one, though. After signing as a free agent in the summer of 1996, Williams played 101 games for the team, averaging 15.3 points and a smidge under five boards a game. His stat-stuffing peak came in a 24-point whooping of the Suns, in which he shot 12-of-19 and hit six of nine three point tries. Williams is certainly at risk of being upset, though. Purely because of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s innate knack for foreshadowing:  In addition to hitting it almost a little too on the nose, Leonard dropped 38 points with three boards, five assists and three steals on 14-of-22 from the floor that night against Portland. (2) Vince scores 48 vs. Bucks - 11/18/00 vs. (15) Mighty Mouse leads Raps past \u201896 Bulls - 3/23/96 For a second time, Vince Carter makes an appearance as a heavily-favoured high seed. For a second time, it\u2019s because he dropped 40-something on the Bucks in the calendar year 2000. This time around, Vince\u2019s scoring explosion was complemented by 10 rebounds, four assists, three steals and a couple blocks, along with just a single miss in his 18 trips to the free-throw line. Toronto won 111-102. It\u2019s unclear what the Bucks did to deserve such cruelty. Occupying the 15-seed is Damon Stoudamire, who had games with more eye-popping numbers in his Raps tenure than his 30-point, four-rebound, 11-assist output on March 23rd, 1996. That said, those numbers were the driving force behind the Raptors\u2019 biggest win of the 90s by a mile, which has to count for something. THE JOHN SAUNDERS REGION (VOTE NOW) (1) Lowry\u2019s 43 leads Raps past Cavs - 2/26/16 vs. (16) PJ Tuckers\u2019 second Raps debut - 2/24/1 At the time, it was touted as the biggest regular season game in Raptors history. On February, 2nd, 2016, LeBron James\u2019 Cavaliers came to town at 40-16, two games clear of the Raptors for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Though Toronto had picked up plenty of nice wins that season, the Cavs were the biggest obstacle in the way of the Raptors\u2019 being viewed as true contenders. That night, as his four fellow starters combined for just 19 points on 6-of-24 shooting, Lowry scored a career-best 43 points, leading the Raptors back from nine down after three to secure a 99-97 victory. Adjusting for opponent and the weight of the moment, there\u2019s a case to be made that Lowry\u2019s step-back to take the lead is the greatest regular season game-winner in Raps history.  Drawing the short stick in this match-up is PJ Tucker on the night he returned to the Raptors. As the legend goes, Tucker took a red-eye flight from Phoenix the day the Raps acquired him for a pair of second-rounders. On no sleep, Tucker suited up for a Raps team that was down Lowry -- and working in fellow new addition Serge Ibaka -- against Isaiah Thomas\u2019 Boston Celtics. Tucker scored nine points and grabbed 10 boards, pairing with Ibaka to form what would become a menacing defensive back-line down the stretch. Among his stand-out moments: a strip steal of Thomas in crunch time, and a super charming post-game scrum. Tucker\u2019s in tough to pull the upset, but he earned his spot in the tourney.  (8) Mo-Pete scores 37 vs. Celtics - 1/12/05 vs. (9) Siakam\u2019s 44-10-2 vs Wizards - 2/13/19 Morris Peterson\u2019s key attribute was understated consistency. He was the iron man who bridged eras of Raptors hoops, rarely flashing star-power, but never dipping below dependable contributor status. He bucked tradition in January 2005, when he scored 37 points to go along with four rebounds and six assists on 12-of-22 shooting with seven made triples in an 11-point home win over Boston. He\u2019s matched up with the Raptors newest star. If you were looking for reasons to believe Siakam could make the transition into true number-one duty before this season, his career-night against the Wizards last year is where you\u2019d start. In the last game before the All-Star break, Siakam used a Leonard load management night to set a new career high with 44 points against Washington. The four threes he canned on five tries were, in retrospect, an ominous sign for defenses everywhere. (5) Charlie V\u2019s 48 as a rookie - 3/26/06 vs. (12) Kawhi scores 37 in OT duel with KD - 11/29/18 Charlie Villaneuva will forever be known as the guy who finished second to Chris Paul in Rookie of the Year voting in 2005-06. Second to Chris Paul! Much like in Ross\u2019 outlier game, the losing result of Charlie V\u2019s career-high 48-point evisceration of Milwaukee is inconsequential. Stepping up in the place of Bosh, who left the game just seven minutes in, Villanueva delivered a 20-of-32 shooting line, and helped push an overmatched Raps squad to overtime where they\u2019d nobly fall. Few rookies have ever offered such promise and hope to the Raptors faithful from the jump like Villanueva did. Charlie V\u2019s in danger of a dreaded 12-over-5 upset. Although the phrase \u201c82 practices\u201d got tossed around in Raps circles last year, that feeling certainly didn\u2019t apply to the Raptors\u2019 tilt with the defending champion Warriors in late November 2018. Once again teasing his own future, Leonard provided the Raps the kind of star power beating the Warriors necessitated, countering a 51-point outburst by Kevin Durant with an efficient 37 of his own.  (4) Vince scores 51 on National TV - 2/27/00 vs. (13) Calderon\u2019s 22 pts &amp; 19 asts vs. CHI - 3/29/09 You could say that Vince\u2019s 51-point night on national TV against Phoenix represented the official arrival of the Raptors into the general consciousness down south. It was the first time the Raps had been shown on national television in the states, making it America\u2019s first nationwide exposure to the Vinsanity phenomenon. Was this Carter performance the inciting incident behind him becoming the antagonist in the Hollywood classic, \u201cLike Mike?\u201d We can\u2019t know for sure, but probably, yes. Up against Vince is another record-setting performance and Jos\u00e9 Calderon\u2019s lone appearance in the tournament. Calderon tied Stoudamire\u2019s franchise record of 19 assists two separate times, the first of which came against Chicago on a night where he also scored 22 points on a very tidy 8-of-11 shooting. And of course, he hit all of his four free throws that night, too.  (6) OG\u2019s 32 with seven steals @ DEN - 03/01/20 vs. (11) Lou Williams\u2019 36 in Cleveland - 11/22/14 Holding the 6-seed in the Saunders Region is the most recent of all 32 entries -- OG Anunoby\u2019s dominant and frankly terrifying seven-steal, 32-point display in Denver. This game took place less than three weeks ago, though it feels like it happened in about 1996. Anunoby\u2019s affinity for demolishing Nikola Jokic-related actions that night kept an extremely undermanned Raptors team within range into crunch time that night. What\u2019s most impressive is that he spent most of the evening as the Raps\u2019 de facto centre with Ibaka and Marc Gasol sidelined. Coronavirus has derailed a great many things in our world, OG\u2019s All-Defense campaign included. It was on the other end of the floor that Lou Williams made enough hay to earn an 11-seed, storming off the bench for 36 points in 29 minutes to buoy the Raptors past Cleveland, 110-93. Consider this game that set the Lou Williams Sixth Man train on a runaway heading. (3) Bargnani drops 41-6-7 @ MSG - 12/8/10 vs. (14) Lowry leads comeback vs. Mavs - 12/22/19 Andrea Bargnani makes his lone appearance in the bracket with a stunning 16-of-24 shooting clinic en route to 41 points in the arena he\u2019d one day call home. It wasn\u2019t quite enough to overcome a 34 and 14 masterclass from Amar\u2019e Stoudamire, but it would linger as one of Il Mago\u2019s high points in a Raps uniform. Kyle Lowry waltzes against a guy who was not traded to the Knicks. Lowry waltzes into his third match-up of the tournament with some extreme \u201cabout to pull an upset\u201d energy, same as he did the day he led the Raptors back from down 30 with about 14 minutes to play days before this past Christmas. As admirable as the efforts of Chris Boucher, Terence Davis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Malcolm Miller were, this was a game coated in Lowry\u2019s fingerprints. He added some pep to his incalculable genius work by dropping 32 points while slinging ten dimes and grabbing eight boards. If you could join a bracket pool for this tournament, this would surely be the sexy upset pick you\u2019d make in an attempt to look smart. (7) Mike James scores 39 in win vs Pistons - 4/14/06 vs. (10) Serge scores 34 &amp; 10 @ LAL - 11/4/18 Mike James gets a spot in the field thanks to the game that clinched his coveted 20 points per-game average in 2005-06. In his second-to-last appearance of the season, James led the lottery-bound Raptors to a five-point win over a 64-win Pistons team with 39 points on 9-of-16 from floor and a perfect 18-of-18 from the stripe. It was James\u2019 fifth 30-point outing in six games, proving unequivocally that he could in fact put the ball in the hole at a very high rate.  Last season also offered proof of Serge Ibaka\u2019s own proclivity for buckets. With Leonard being eased into the rigours of full-time basketball early in the year, someone had to shoot, and Ibaka obliged. His 34-point outing on 15-of-17(!) shooting against LeBron James\u2019 Lakers was the second of two 30-point nights he recorded in 2018-19, and still stands as his single-game personal best. In concert with Lowry\u2019s 21 points and 15 assists, Ibaka helped Toronto pull out a 121-107 road win, moving the future champs to 9-1. (2) Bosh scores 40-5-5 vs. Dwight\u2019s Magic - 2/20/08 vs. (15) Keon Clark\u2019s 12-block game - 3/23/01 While the Raptors\u2019 tango with Dwight Howard\u2019s Magic in the 2008 postseason was forgettable, at least one regular season matchup between the teams that year offered a road map to a Raptors upset. As you might expect, it involved Chris Bosh doing superstar things. With 40 points, five rebounds and five assists, Bosh notched his highest ever Basketball Reference Game Score in a winning effort (40.1). Between hitting 14 of his 16 attempts from the field, and a perfect night on 11 free throws, Bosh amassed a True Shooting percentage of 96.0, outdoing Howard and leading Toronto to a 127-110 signature win. On the other end of the match-up is a true anomaly, not only as far as the Raptors are concerned, but within the NBA\u2019s 70-plus years of recorded stats. On March 23rd, 2001, Keon Clark became just the 15th player to record at least 12 blocks in a single game -- a feat that\u2019s only been achieved 35 times in history, and just twice since that day in 2001. He\u2019d finish just two rebounds shy of one of the coolest triple doubles you could possibly conceive. That does it for the first round of match-ups!

{"team": "raptors", "url": "https://www.nba.com/raptors/while-we-wait-for-hoops-take-some-time-to-appreciate-the-defending-champs", "date": "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "tags": ["Raptors"], "article": " When the NBA season came to a halt Wednesday night, every team in the league had a story interrupted. For some, the theme of\u00a0 2019-20 was rebuilding, the promise of some not so far away hope. Other teams were in the heat of thrilling tales of ahead-of-schedule accomplishment. The league\u2019s super-elite were still a couple months out from their narrative arcs really gaining steam. All these yarns slotted in somewhere along the spectrum of riveting to ho-hum. For those teams, and their fans, it\u2019s a shame that each and every one might be stuck without a concluding chapter. But of all the stories unfairly cut short by the Covid-19 pandemic, the one the Raptors were telling might have been the most compelling. A global emergency can take away the stretch run, maybe even the playoffs. It most certainly can\u2019t, however, erase the 64 games worth of unrelenting joy the defending champs dished out this season. This was a team in the midst of something special, featuring an uncommon brew of charming traits that made them impossible for fans not to love, and for outside observers to not respect like hell. Toronto entered the season free from the straightjacket that is expectation. Last year\u2019s team dealt with that daily reality, and while the end result left a country in hysterics, the season was spent with a burbling pit in the stomach of those watching the team; the weight of every regular-season game and postseason possession was palpable. There\u2019s a reason the release on June 13th was nation-consuming. Without the burden of expectation, Toronto entered the year with a canvas on which they could paint as they pleased. In true Serge Ibaka fashion, they didn\u2019t just play basketball -- they made art. This team\u2019s pantry was stocked full with all the ingredients for a good time. The comfort and ease of having a gigantic ring nestled snugly on their fingers; veterans, both young and old, championship seasoned and with unselfishness baked deep into their bones; pieces of the future making leaps of all shapes and sizes; the underdog spirit than only a thousand injuries can ignite; off-court goofiness to humanize them all -- everyone one of those components congealed to create the kind of basketball team you get out of bed to watch. Connectivity defined these Raptors. Offensively, Toronto\u2019s egalitarian, read-and-react attack wasn\u2019t designed to funnel the action to any one player or particular section of the floor. The beauty of a Raptors possession was in its possibilities. Whatever the outcome, be it a pull-up triple from Kyle Lowry or Fred VanVleet, a security blanket-like Serge Ibaka mid-range jumper, or a late-clock OG Anunoby three off a gorgeous perimeter swing, you could be sure that it was borne out of sound and pretty process. Give the Raps a chance to gear up in the open court, and you were bound to get scored on. On the backs of Norman Powell\u2019s speed-shifting finesse around the rim, and Pascal Siakam\u2019s graceful thunder, the Raptors scored more points per game in transition (28.3) than anyone else. Of course you don\u2019t rack up numbers on the run without forcing plenty of misses. If the offense got its juice from each guy reading the movements and beats of his teammates, Toronto\u2019s defense was powered by straight-up telepathy. Marc Gasol was the order-barking anchor; Lowry and VanVleet stood stoutly in the way of would-be slashers; Siakam and Anunoby terrorized the wings, lunging out to contest threes so effectively that the team could defy math. Toronto allowed the second-most three point tries in the league, but defended them more ferociously than anyone, with just 33.7 percent of opposing triples dropping in. Control-F the top-10 ranks in NBA.com\u2019s hustle stats, and you\u2019ll see the Raps pop up more than any other team. What was truly remarkable about Toronto\u2019s second-ranked defense was the interchangeability of its pieces. When Gasol sat, Serge Ibaka admirably slotted in to swat shots and drop thumbs. If Ibaka joined Gasol on the sidelines, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson became a perfectly suitable small-ball stop-gap. Cycling in off the bench were Patrick McCaw and his on-ball peskiness, Powell\u2019s eagerness to jump passing lanes, and Chris Boucher\u2019s maniacal urge to slap away shots both inside and out -- 7.1 percent of all shots taken with the Canadian on the floor ended in a block, usually of the demoralizing persuasion. Those end-of-bench contributions were a necessity this season, as the Raptors dealt with more injuries than any other playoff-bound team. By game 64, the Raps ever-revolving door of battered and bruised core players stopped being a cute story, and flirted with becoming an existential threat to the team\u2019s playoff ambitions. But there\u2019s no denying that the swell of injuries, and the reserves\u2019 responses to it, enriched the season with excess glee. Raptors fans got to take in more memorable regular season games than any fan base has a right to, with injuries often clearing the way for unexpected joy. It started the second Lowry and Ibaka went down with their early-November thumb and ankle injuries. That night in New Orleans, Siakam tied a career-high with 44 points, while Anunoby hit 5-of-7 triples on the way to 21 easy points. This was a season about plotting the next two, three, even five years of the franchise; that 122-104 win over the Pelicans was one of many glimpses into a future that looks pretty darn alright. From the Big Easy the Raptors travelled to Los Angeles, where on the first night of a Staples Center back-to-back, Raps fans got a taste of the short-handed tenacity for which the team would come to be renowned.\u00a0 That was the night the Triumvirate of Chaos -- Boucher, Hollis-Jefferson and Terence Davis -- got intro\u2019d to the basketball world, scoring 38 combined bench points on 16-of-25 shooting. It was also the debut of Nick Nurse\u2019s star-killer defense, which held LeBron James to just 5-of-15 from the field.  Uproarious success in the face of injury became the 2019-20 Raptors\u2019 calling card. As the Raptors tested new limits in the accrual of busted extremities, new deep-bench heroes stepped in to earn their moments, while a walking legend added inches to the statue that should one day stand in Jurassic Park. Each player on this year\u2019s Raptors played a part in ushering along the Raptors\u2019 narrative, but more than anyone else, this was Kyle Lowry\u2019s story to tell. This was the year the broader NBA world grew to appreciate the reality Raptors fans have been basking in since 2013: Lowry is a basketball savant, who colours in between the box score columns more vibrantly than just about anyone in the world. He\u2019s no slouch inside the lines either, as a step back up the ladder of responsibility saw Lowry rediscover his scoring knack. 33-year-olds aren\u2019t supposed to average lines of 20-5-8 on 59 percent True Shooting. But like his team, Lowry isn\u2019t one for preconceived notions. Lowry\u2019s most awe-inspiring moments this season came when they were most needed. Despite missing 12 games of his own, Lowry led the team in minutes played before the season stoppage, simply because of his indispensability when other Raptors were sidelined. He put his beefed up playing time to good use, adding even more signature Kyle Lowry Games to a list already pages-long. December 22nd\u2019s game against the visiting Mavs will go down as a Lowry all-timer, while also being the game that most plainly embodied the relentless, excuse-free M.O. of the defending champs. Down 30 with two minutes to go in the third quarter, and with the half-court offense unable to muster much without so many of its smoothing cogs, Lowry just kind of decided the Raptors were winning the game, ripping off 20 of his 32 points in a fourth-quarter the Raptors won by 26. The next night, on the road in Indiana, Lowry\u2019s inspired 30-point, six-rebound, nine-assist effort very nearly earned the banged up Raps an overtime win. And just five days later, in a rematch against Boston after a disappointing Christmas Day loss, Lowry did the thing again. His 30 points, seven assists and 10-of-17 mark from the floor powered Toronto to a 16-point win at the always unforgiving TD Garden. It was around this time that a sixth-straight All-Star nod became an inevitability. In Chicago, at the league\u2019s mid-February showcase, no one leaned harder into the Elam Ending than Lowry, the man who will forever go down as the guy who took two charges in an All-Star Game. Though as he\u2019ll tell you: \u201cIt should have been three.\u201d Every admirable trait these Raptors possessed, from their competitiveness, to their cerebral understanding of the game, to their comradery on and off the court, Lowry exudes in abundance. He\u2019s a human pitch pipe, setting the tone and tenor for every game, quarter and possession he plays, as well as most of the ones he watches from the bench. He was the engine that turned blas\u00e9 weeknights into bursts of supreme fun, November through March. That was true up until the very last game the Raptors played before the sports world hit the pause button. The list of excuses against the Jazz this past Monday was overwhelming. On a back-to-back, at altitude, on the final game of a western trip, with their starting centre out, and the reigning Player of the Week ruled out 90 seconds in -- all would have justified a loss on their own, and none mattered even one bit. With Lowry steadying the ship after the loss of Powell (and briefly Anunoby), Siakam reaching previously unseen play making heights, Ibaka flummoxing the defending Defensive Player of the Year, and Anunoby turning in the latest in a long line of marauding defensive efforts, the Raptors pulled out the 101-92 win by tapping into every inch of their identity. A sense of tenacious calm leading the way, booned by tested and reliable depth, and a pair of 20-somethings discovering more of their own substantial gifts. If it happens that Monday\u2019s game was the last one played by this remarkable team, the Raptors story will be unfinished, yes, but it\u2019ll have paused on one hell of a high note. It\u2019s not often, after all, that a champion comes back and wins the final game of their title defense campaign. Toronto may not get the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with the Sixers or the Celtics or the Bucks. A screenplay-worthy NBA Finals match-up with an old friend might not get the chance to take place. Wherever these uncharted waters are heading, though, Raptors fans can rest easy, knowing that few teams in NBA history can claim to have defended a championship as nobly as the one they got to watch for 64 games this season. And if happens that the Raptors do get a chance to finish their 2019-20 tale, you can guarantee these fierce, admirable champs will pick up the story in the exact spot they left off.       "}

There are kiddie pools and water toys waiting for summer. There have been bike rides and afternoons with building blocks. And the closest the Utah Jazz forward has come to putting on a uniform in the past two months was the day he dressed up like Olaf, the snowman from the movie \u201cFrozen\u201d. The global COVID-19 pandemic has changed so many aspects of our lives. It has upended our plans. For Ingles, it has thrown a promising NBA season into jeopardy. It has also provided the 32-year-old Aussie with opportunity and a renewed appreciation for what matters to him most. And as Ingles considers the questions the future holds\u2014Would he leave his wife and two children alone at home to finish out the season? When will it be time to retire? Would he ever want Matt Harpring\u2019s job?\u2014the answers will always be about family. \u201cBeing with my kids all day can make for long days,\u201d Ingles said Friday on a conference call with local media. \u201cBut it\u2019s been awesome to get up with them every morning and be there to put them to bed. I don\u2019t usually get to do that.\u201d Since the NBA season was suspended on March 11, Ingles and his family, his wife Renae and twins, Jacob and Milla, have stayed safe and sequestered together at home. The Jazz forward hopes the NBA season can safely resume, though he said he has some reservations about potentially exposing himself and his family to the Coronavirus. \u201cObviously I would love to go back and play,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cOn the flip side, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to risk catching it and giving it to my family, especially with Milla and Jacob. So all of the scenarios that have been thrown out, we\u2019d have to debate it at the time.\u201d Ingles\u2019 doubts about saving the 2019-20 season grow with each day. He has been working in his home gym and shooting on an outdoor hoop he just acquired. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find the motivation to leave [the kids] and go work out,\u201d Ingles said. It would be harder still to leave them for several weeks should the season resume with teams quarantined in a central location, such as Las Vegas. \"That would be basically the longest I've been away from the kids \u2014 which I don't know how much I'm willing to do that, as much as I love playing basketball,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cLeaving them for two or three months would be borderline impossible for me. But obviously we\u2019ll wait until a decision is made.\u201d Ingles said he and his family were planning to remain in Utah this summer, even before stay at home orders were put in place. Renae Ingles\u2019 netball career had required her to be in Australia for several months starting each April. With Renae retired from the game, the family had planned to remain for their first summer in the state. Though Ingles said he briefly considered returning to Australia after the magnitude 5.7 earthquake rocked Utah back on March 20. \u201cMilla was saying our house was shaking and our house in Australia doesn\u2019t shake,\u201d Ingles said. The Ingleses hope to stay in Utah next summer, too. Though the proud Aussie said he will return to his native country whenever he retires. So when Jazz play-by-play man Craig Bolerjack asked Ingles if he would consider joining him on the broadcast one day, Ingles politely declined. \u201cWe will be living in Australia when I\u2019m done,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can do color commentating via Zoom. But if we were going to live [in Utah] I would definitely steal Harpring\u2019s job.\u201d Asked whether these recent developments had changed his thinking about his future and retirement plans, Ingles once again circled back to his family. \u201cWhen I signed that extension for another year, I thought it put me in a really good spot age-wise to make a decision on my career,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I want to stay here? Do I want to go back to Australia? \u201cMy whole plan was to play out my deal and make a decision after that. But if it\u2019s time to go home and put them in school and settle down, that\u2019s obviously my first priority. It\u2019s not whether I want to keep playing. It\u2019s a family deal.\u201d   "}

The player selections were approved by the USA Basketball Board of Directors. The official 12-member 2020 U.S. Olympic Men\u2019s Basketball Team roster will be announced later this year. Currently in his eighth NBA season, Barnes is averaging 13.6 points (.446 FG%, .372 3pt%, .795 FT%), 4.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 0.7 steals per game in 592 appearances with three teams; Golden State (2013-16), Dallas (2016-18), and Sacramento (2018-20). During the 2019-20 season, he is averaging 14.5 points (.450 FG%, .355 3pt%, .798 FT%), 4.9 rebounds, 2.2 assists, and 0.6 steals per game in 52 contests (all starts) for the Kings. As a gold medalist with the U.S. Olympic Men\u2019s National Team in 2016, Barnes appeared in four games and averaged 4.3 points (.426 FG%, .333 3pt%, 4-4 FT) and grabbed 1.3 rebounds per game. During the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, he averaged 11.6 points (.476 FG%, .333 3pt%, 24-27 FT), 4.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game in eight contests with Team USA. Featuring 29 players who have played for the USA in Olympic and/or FIBA World Cup competitions and who together have collected 31 Olympic or FIBA Basketball World Cup gold medals and four bronze medals, the 44 finalists for the 2020 U.S. Olympic Team also include: Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat); LaMarcus Aldridge (San Antonio Spurs); Bradley Beal (Washington Wizards); Devin Booker (Phoenix Suns); Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers); Jaylen Brown (Boston Celtics);\u00a0Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat); Mike Conley (Utah Jazz); Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors); Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers); DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs); Andre Drummond (Cleveland Cavaliers); Kevin Durant (Brooklyn Nets); Paul George (L.A.

Barnes is among nine players from the 2016 U.S. Olympic team, including Butler, DeRozan, Durant, George, Green, Irving, Lowry and Thompson, that went 8-0 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and who remain in contention for the 2020 U.S. Olympic squad. All 12 members of the USA\u2019s 2019 World Cup Team are finalists and include Barnes, Brown, Joe Harris, Lopez, Middleton, Mitchell, Plumlee, Smart, Tatum, Turner, Walker and White. The USA National Team coaching staff is led by San Antonio Spurs head coach\u00a0Gregg Popovich, and serving as USA assistant coaches are Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, Atlanta Hawks head coach\u00a0Lloyd Pierce\u00a0and Villanova University head coach\u00a0Jay Wright. \u201cThis is the first step in USA Basketball identifying the 12 players who will represent the United States as members of the 2020 U.S. Olympic Men\u2019s Basketball Team in Tokyo,\u201d said Jerry Colangelo, who has served as the managing director of the USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team since 2005. \u201cThe commitment, desire and excitement of all of our athletes to represent their country is genuine and remarkable. All of the finalists are exceptionally gifted athletes who offer us amazing versatility and depth, and the group of finalists features a range of players from those who are very experienced and accomplished in international basketball to players who will be future international stars. \u201cOver the course of the remainder of the NBA season we\u2019ll continue to monitor all of the athletes. Selecting the 12-man USA roster will obviously be an extremely challenging and difficult process, and we will again attempt to select the very best team possible to represent our country and who we hope will be successful in our difficult mission of repeating as Olympic champions for a fourth consecutive Olympics.\u201d "}

The Utah Jazz point guard is the NBA\u2019s reigning HORSE king after beating out Chris Paul, Trae Young, Zach LaVine and others to win an All-Star shooting competition this week. But Conley is hopeful that, despite the complications and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, he and his Jazz teammates will still get a shot at playing for an NBA title this season. In a call with reporters on Friday, Conley discussed his trick-shot skills, how he is staying ready to play, and why he\u2019s feeling some optimism in a difficult time. Q: Did the HORSE competition help with staving off some stir-craziness with all of the social isolation? A: It helped a lot. All of us guys are looking for something to do, for someone to compete against. There are only so many video games you can play before we really start to go crazy. Q: What were your favorite shots from the competition? A: I liked Chris Paul\u2019s shot, the one where he held his leg and had his back to the basket and had to turn around and shoot a one-arm shot. That was pretty creative. One of my favorite shots was the one where I spin it on my finger and punch it off the backboard and into the hoop. That\u2019s one I\u2019ve been working on over the years. I couldn\u2019t make it at all in the first couple of rounds but I finally got it to fall in the last one. Head to our TikTok and duet Mike's spin/punch layup We wanna see you match the champ!https://t.co/k7kJOjyDDH pic.twitter.com/O5MRpJtFhm \u2014 utahjazz (@utahjazz) April 17, 2020 Q: Did you know you were this good at HORSE? You were uniquely creative in the competition. A: I play HORSE every day, after every workout. We\u2019ll run two or three games right after we get done working out. We get really creative. I saved a lot of that, didn\u2019t show too much. But it\u2019s a fun game to just let loose. Q: You have your own court at home. What kind advantage was that and how much will having a court or not impact players when you return to NBA action? A: It was a real advantage. I didn\u2019t know going in what everybody had or didn\u2019t have. I just knew I had a hoop. It definitely helped being indoors. A lot of guys don\u2019t have that. I can\u2019t imagine how tough it is to not have touched a ball or shot a ball for the last month or so. We\u2019re so used to being in a regiment and routine. That getting broken up can really affect guys in different ways. Q: How much preparation went into this competition? A: Honestly, I didn\u2019t think too much. I already had five or six go-to shots, and I knew nobody was going to use their off-hand like I would. I would just use that to my advantage at any point I felt like I Was getting pressured or pushed. A little advice from Coach #TeamMike | @espn pic.twitter.com/VEuApVlmm6 \u2014 utahjazz (@utahjazz) April 17, 2020 Q: Who is the best HORSE player on the Jazz? A: Bojan Bogdanovic would be my pick to dethrone me. He\u2019s got a lot of tricks. He\u2019s a tricky dude. And obviously he can shoot way better than me. Q: Who is the best HORSE player you\u2019ve played against? A: Vince Carter is a guy I used to play against. He could sit down on the opposite free throw line and throw it with one arm and make it. He\u2019s just super talented like that. Q: When you think back a month ago to the night in OKC when the league suspended play, what sticks out to you? A: Looking back now, it just shocks me how much we didn\u2019t know about COVID or what was going on. We knew what we knew from the news, but being on the frontline was surreal and scary. That\u2019s why we take it more seriously than a lot of people. Once it\u2019s right in front of you, it\u2019s real. This is definitely a threat to all of us. To see the league completely shut down in a matter of minutes \u2026 looking back on it was just like something you would see in a movie. Q: What have you been able to do in isolation and how have you stayed connected with your teammates over the last three or four weeks? A: Zoom meetings and FaceTime. We just had a meeting earlier today where we go to talk to each other and hang out. Coach gives us things he wants us to do or not do. It\u2019s been cool to see those guys on a weekly basis. We\u2019ve had fun little dribbling challenges that one of the coaches started and we\u2019ll crown a winner each week. Q: What is Coach Quin Snyder telling the team? A: We\u2019re feeling more and more confident that something could happen where we\u2019re able to play again. There are just so many things logistically to work out and so many things with COVID-19 itself that are unknown. But we\u2019re optimistic. Q: Where is that optimism coming from? A: We\u2019ve had calls with the NBPA and NBA. It seems like there are things that are coming together. It makes it feel as if a plan is slowly coming in place and we\u2019re headed in the right direction. Hopefully the virus itself will flatten out a little bit more and more each day and give us a better indication on when we\u2019d possibly have the green light to get back in the gym together. Q: The pandemic will impact everything and there are a lot of different scenarios being floated on how the season might look if it\u2019s resumed. How do you feel about those things? A: Safety is first for everybody. We want to continue to adhere to all of the regulations made by our state and the country. So if there\u2019s a safe route and it makes sense for us to be able to play and entertain people, we\u2019re all ready and willing to do it. If that means we\u2019re going to be in one location for an extended period of time or isolated amongst a small group of teams, I think we\u2019re willing and ready to do that. But safety is No. 1. We want to make sure everybody is doing the right thing. The NBA won\u2019t let us out there until they feel comfortable. Q: Has it been difficult to stay physically and mentally engaged? A: I\u2019ve been engaged in each workout and trying to stay in regular-season mode, but it\u2019s different. It does feel like this is the offseason, the point where we\u2019re supposed to rest. You kind of get that vibe but that\u2019s not the feeling you want right now. You want to continue to put your foot on the gas and continue working. It has been a challenge for every guy. I\u2019m just trying to stay on top of it. Q: If you get the green light to return to practice, how long would it take to get back to playing at an NBA level? A: It\u2019s tough to say. For every team and player it would be different. The reason why I\u2019m working like I\u2019m working now is because I don\u2019t want to need a month to get ready when we do get that greenlight. I want to hit the ground running. But every situation is different. You don\u2019t want guys to get injured because we have to start up so quickly and get right into a playoff level. I don\u2019t think anybody has had to do that in the past. Q: Would you be able to play games without fans? A: Of course. We all just want to play at the end of the day. That\u2019s not the ideal situation. We\u2019d love to have our arenas packed, especially with a great homecourt situation like we have in Salt Lake. There\u2019s none better than that. So that kind of takes away that feel and aspect of the game. But being away from the game for a month and not knowing when you\u2019re going to play again, it gives you a perspective on how much you love it and how much you want to be out there competing, regardless of the situation. Q: Your family announced that you\u2019re expecting a baby. What has that been like during these times? A: That was my first thought and worry. There wasn\u2019t a lot of research or cases documented of what happens with pregnant women or children when they\u2019re born. So it was really scary for us. But my wife has been feeling great. No issues. We\u2019re just trying to make sure our family is safe right now. Hopefully there are no complications for anyone who is pregnant. Q: What else have you been doing with your time? A: Outside of working out, I chase the kids around and it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m really thankful for the nights we get in hotels on road trips. The kids are a handful. My wife being pregnant, she can\u2019t do as much right now. I\u2019m doing a lot with them. I\u2019ve also been playing Call of Duty with Royce and Donovan and those guys. Playing Monopoly with Ed Davi. I\u2019m trying to get Joe Ingles involved. Netflix is probably running through every TV in the house 24/7. We\u2019ve just got normal things going on.   "}

Utah Jazz point guard Mike Conley beat Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine to earn the honors of HORSE champion on Thursday night. After topping WNBA legend Tamika Catchings in the quarterfinals last week, Conley took care of business against retired NBA star Chauncey Billups in the semifinals before besting LaVine in the star-studded competition on ESPN. Conley\u2019s victory netted a $200,000 donation to a charity of his choice. Conley got LaVine in a two-letter hole by banking in a behind-the-back shot and sinking an eyes-closed free throw. Then he followed up with an off-handed 3-pointer, a move he\u2019d used throughout the competition. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got an array of shots to pull from,\u201d Jazz head coach Quin Snyder told Conely. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t forget about the ambidextrous package. It\u2019s always hard for me to remember if the left or the right is the strong hand.\u201d Conley ultimately finished LaVine by sinking a layup from the other side of the backboard. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, especially just being a part of the first one,\u201d Conley said after his win. \u201cTo be able to compete with these guys, they were great opponents. It was just a fun environment to be part of it and give us all something to do in this time when we\u2019re all just sitting around the house.\u201d But, as Conley said, if it takes staying at home to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic, it's the right thing for people to do. \u201cStay safe right now, please,\u201d Conley told fans. \u201cThese are desperate times all over the world, frankly. We\u2019re all affected by it.

Wall also partnered with Chick-Fil-A to provide approximately 600 meals for front line workers and first responders at each location. Both locations hold a special place in Wall\u2019s heart. Wall lost his mother, Frances Pulley, to breast cancer in December. In the months leading up to her passing, Pulley received the majority of her medical care from MedStar Washington Hospital Center and spent her final days at UNC Rex Hospital in Wall\u2019s hometown of Raleigh. The donations of masks and meals at both locations were made in Ms. Pulley\u2019s name. In addition to providing the much-needed supplies and meals, Wall took time to connect with the doctors and nurses in both hospitals. Wall conducted an interview with Ashley Jenkins, registered nurse and ICU Patient Care Manager at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, for CloseUp360.com and, at both locations, held group Zoom conversations with doctors and nurses to say thank you for all the work they are doing to combat the pandemic. Wall also extended Jenkins an invite to a future Wizards game.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet and talk with some special people, nurses, doctors, front line responders and healthcare workers from two hospitals @Rexhealthcare and MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

I wanted to thank them for all the care they provided to me and my family, and most importantly thank and acknowledge them for all of their work and sacrifice to fight the COVID-19 virus.

{"team": "wizards", "url": "https://www.nba.com/wizards/q-and-a-ariel-woolfolk-042220", "date": "2020-04-22 00:00:00", "tags": ["Wizards"], "article": " In the next installment of a series of interviews with members of the Wizards\u2019 business staff, Wizards Digital interviewed Ariel Woolfolk, a videographer on the Wizards\u2019 productions team. Q: Can you talk a little about your career path and what your role is with Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment? Well, I started my production career during my senior year in college. At first, I thought I wanted to become a sports news anchor, but after completing an internship with a local television station, I concluded that it was not for me. I then applied and was accepted to an internship program with the Washington Wizards. That internship allowed me to see all aspects of sports media from a team\u2019s standpoint. From on-air talents, producers, editors, and videographers. This is where I discovered my passion for cinematography and storytelling. I was mentored by a past supervisor producer and lead videographer of the Wizards at the time. They let me explore, make mistakes, and learn. From starting as an intern to now being the main shooter for the Washington Wizards, it has been a long but rewarding journey. Q: When did you first aspire to have a career that you have? The first time I picked up a camera during my internship with the Wizards, I knew I wanted to learn more and follow this career path. After watching the production department put together stories with the players throughout the season, I knew I wanted to try my hand at this type of video production. Q: A female lead shooter is unfortunately still not the majority yet in Japan, but what is the male to female ratio in the NBA and in sports from your experience? Have there been any challenges leading up to your role that you remember? When I first started with the Wizards, I rarely saw a female videographer. There was a female producer with the Wizards during the time of my internship who filmed, produced and edited content. That was my first encounter with a female videographer. I am not sure of the ratio of male to female within the NBA but let\u2019s just say, I have traveled to every NBA arena and have probably only seen a handful of women filming. Although, from the time I started in this line of work until now, the number of women videographers have grown. Unfortunately, that number is still quite small. Also, there have been several challenges being a young, African American woman videographer that I have encountered throughout the years. I would say at the beginning of my career, being a woman, in general, in sports, many people question your motives since you work so closely with the team and players. You have to ignore the stigmas people place on you and just focus on your work. By doing this, people began to focus on my work and no longer on me. Q: What do you emphasize and value the most in shooting the players off-the-court? I think I enjoy filming the players off the court more than on the court. The games are fun, and I love capturing all the emotions and passion that happen during the game, but off the court, you get to see who the guys really are. It is such a unique privilege that I get, to immerse myself in their worlds and allow the fans to get to see the players as more than basketball stars but humans first. They have families, different hobbies, and fun personalities. I love storytelling and documentary-style filming, and the NBA social content is now leaning in that direction where fans want to see more than cool dunks and 3-pointers. Q: What do you do to help bring out a player\u2019s personality when filming? Most players when they first meet the production team are polite but somewhat quiet. There are rare occasions when the players are outgoing by nature and embrace the cameras. Fortunately for me, I have the greatest advantage: wherever the players are, I am too. I attend every practice, event and game during the season. This allows the players to see me every day which helps them become more familiar and comfortable with me. I never push them to do things they are uncomfortable with because my goal is to make them look as good as possible, showing their true self. If the players are uncomfortable then it shows up on camera and I don\u2019t want that. Being with the team on a day-to-day basis helps me build relationships with not only the players, but the coaches, front office and even medical team. Q: How do you critique your work personally and define whether or not it was successful? I am a very tough critic of myself and my work. There are only a few occasions during the course of my career in which I have been 100% satisfied with my work. There are so many areas that you grow to be better in this field and I see so many areas that I can improve upon. I hate things to look the same all the time, so I watch a lot of film and video tutorials. There are so many tips, tricks, and techniques that you could do. It\u2019s amazing. I also like to watch what other teams are doing, not only in the NBA but as the NFL, MLB, MLS, etc. Everyone seems to be coming up with creative content nowadays, so there is always something I can add to my style of filming. But to answer your questions in short, I am not sure how to tangibly explain when I know something is successful, I just know internally when I am genuinely pleased with something I create. Q: You have shot many players in the past, but do you have a Wizards player that is most memorable? I have filmed so many great guys over the years but the one player that sticks out to me among the bunch would be Paul Pierce. I remember watching him play with my father when I was younger, and I remember thinking how intense of a guy he was. He seemed so aggressive on the floor and would just be in players faces during the game. He was picked up by the Wizards, that had to be the most amazing year for the basketball team and the productions team. I had such a fun year filming the team and the playoff run, I never thought I would ever be able to personally experience something like that. But Paul Pierce as a person, was so fun to be around. He was dedicated to the team and the players and enjoyed being on camera. We were able to film him in so many different settings and he was so welcoming and genuine. Even when he left the Wizards, when he came back to arena to play, he would always spot me out to catch up and just chat. Q: What was your impression when the Wizards drafted Rui Hachimura and your first day working with him? My first encounter with Rui was the day we drafted him. My first impression of him was that he polite and quiet. We filmed him the entire day and then rode the train back with him for his welcoming ceremony at the Wizards arena. He didn\u2019t speak much during the train ride, but he did offer me a piece of Japanese candy, which I thought was very nice of him. It takes a while for players to warm up to you, especially when you start off with having to film on the first day you meet them. With Rui, because of all the media attention he has already had during his basketball career before the NBA, the cameras didn\u2019t seem to faze him. Q: Many people aspire to be in the position where you are now. What kind of an advice would you give them? Whenever I am asked this question, I always advise young college students to take advantage of internships. Internships helped me eliminate and determine what I wanted to do after graduation. Also, the internship introduced me to my mentors who wanted to see me learn and grow. Internship greatly influenced where I am today, professionally. The last piece of advice is not to let anyone deter you from you dreams. When I first mentioned to my family that I wanted to work in sports and film, they were supportive but figured that this was phase and that it would pass. Even when I got this position, people still questioned by motives and wondered how long this would last. My faith also played a strong role in my endurance of not giving up when things got tough. I knew what I wanted, and nothing could persuade me to give that up. "}

This season, Mahinmi\u2019s greatest impact has come on the defensive end, highlighted by 13 games with multiple blocks, though he has put on some of his best all-around performances of his career. On the offensive end, his best games of the season have been defined by efficiency, including four games this season with a field goal percentage above 70.0% on seven-plus attempts. Below is a closer look at Mahinmi\u2019s three best overall performances of the season. 3. January 12, 2020 vs. Utah Playing against Rudy Gobert, one of the league\u2019s most decorated defensive big men of this generation, Mahinmi tweaked his game and put on one of his most balanced performances of his career. He scored 15 points on 5-7 (.714) from the field, but his contributions spanned each column of the box score. He did most of his scoring in the first half, totaling nine of his 15 points, while his second half was highlighted by five of his career-high seven assists. In what was his only game this season with more than four dimes, Mahinmi also grabbed six rebounds and recorded a pair of blocks. 2. January 20, 2020 vs. Detroit In the Wizards\u2019 mid-afternoon Martin Luther King Day win over the Pistons, Mahinmi tallied his second 20-point performance of his career and his second game of the season shooting at least 90.0% from the field. He is one of just four players this season with multiple games shooting at least 90.0% from the field on at least 10 attempts. \u201cIan was all over the floor,\u201d Wizards head coach Scott Brooks said postgame. \u201cI thought he played outstanding on both ends. Throughout the game, he gave us great defensive presence and awareness.\u201d Mahinmi was 5-6 (.833) from the field in the first half, but saved his best work for the decisive fourth quarter. He scored seven points on 3-3 (1.000) from the field to go along with five rebounds in the final frame, propelling the Wizards from a two-point deficit to a 10-point lead and an eventual win. In addition to his scoring output, Mahinmi\u2019s showing against the Pistons was one of five this season with at least three blocks and one of two games this season with multiple blocks and steals. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling,\u201d Mahinmi said postgame. \u201cYou know me, I\u2019m not a really big stat guy. Honestly, I like to impact the game especially on the defensive end. When I have nights like that, when things are going well offensively, my teammates are looking for me, it\u2019s a good feeling. I don\u2019t pay too much attention to it, but I appreciate it. If you see the way I scored today, it\u2019s really a credit to my teammates. They find me at the right the time, the right place to dunk the ball, to shoot a couple of threes. It\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d  1. December 30, 2019 vs. Miami In one of the Wizards\u2019 most memorable games of the season, Mahinmi scored a career-high 25 points to help lead Washington to a win over Miami. Playing in just his 12th game of the season, Mahinmi had yet to score in double figures before his dominant performance against the Heat. Mahinmi did most of his damage in the first half. He was 6-6 (1.000) from the field for 14 points in the first quarter and went into halftime with 19 points on 8-8 (1.000) from the field, leading the Wizards to an eight-point lead. He scored just six points in the second half, but helped Washington preserve its lead and hold on to the win. Despite Mahinmi\u2019s career-best scoring output, Brooks said it was his performance on both ends of the court that stood out to him the most. \u201cI thought defensively he was really good,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe put him in some tough matchups, he was on pointing and switches, he protected the rim, got back in transition, he made a three. He played a great game. The best game of his career, his career high. He played hard on both ends.\u201d \u201cI thought I got into a good rhythm,\u201d Mahinmi said. \u201cI was aggressive at the rim; I got a few easy baskets and that got me going. I just wanted to be a little bit more aggressive. Obviously, we are missing a lot of key guys, so I kind of took it upon me to come out a little bit more aggressive.\u201d  "}

The timing of your meals make a big difference. Click through the slides to see Wizards eat to optimize their energy, and give you some tips and recipes to help you do the same. Breakfast: starting off the day with a high-energy meal sets the tone for the day. On practice days everyone has some kind of carbs. We love steel cut oats with berries and nuts, sweet potato pancakes and acai bowls. These meals are a mix of simple and complex carbs and also have protein \u2013 what does that mean for you? A quick boost of energy followed by a long slow stream of energy to last through the morning. Post workout: having some protein and carbs right after a workout increases your energy stores and endurance. Most of the Wizards like to have a shake right after their workout. Your body size determines how many grams of carbs and protein you need. As a general rule: divide your weight by 2 and that\u2019s how many grams of carb you need. Then divide the number of carbs by 3 and that\u2019s how many grams of protein you should have in your post workout snack. Lunch: If the Wizards have a night game, we have a nice big lunch with plenty of carbs. Eating those carbs about four hours before game time ensures that we\u2019ll have tons of energy til the last shot. If you\u2019re someone who likes to workout late in the afternoon, having some pasta or a grain bowl will boost your energy. Afternoon snack: On game days we always have a pre-game or afternoon snack. Half a PBJ and a banana does the trick. You might not need the same energy boost as a Wizard but an afternoon snack is a chance to get in good nutrients and make sure you don\u2019t overeat at dinner. Some good ideas include carrot sticks and hummus, beef jerky or a handful of almonds and walnuts. If you have an athlete in the house, try one of our home made energy bars instead. Click through for the recipe. Dinner: Our dinners often come at 10:00 after a game ends. The average person should eat their dinner a little earlier and focus on lots of protein and vegetables. In order to optimize your energy for the next day you need a good night\u2019s sleep, so keep your dinner on the light side. Fill half your plate with protein and the other half with vegetables and salad.  Procedure "}
{"team": "wizards", "url": "https://www.nba.com/wizards/closer-look-at-how-the-wizards-2k-simulations-came-together-041620", "date": "2020-04-16 00:00:00", "tags": ["Wizards"], "article": " Just over one month ago, the sports world screeched to a halt as the NBA, NHL and leagues everywhere suspended operations in wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. With the sports calendar suddenly blank and a return to normalcy to be determined, business was on hold. Broadcast slots were open and fans, isolated at home with more time than ever before, were left craving any bit of sports-centric entertainment that could be offered. Monumental Sports and Entertainment (MSE) and NBC Sports Washington had a plan: virtual simulations of both the Wizards\u2019 and Capitals\u2019 remaining regular season games through NBA 2K20 (Take-Two Interactive) and NHL 20 (EA Sports). Zach Leonsis, Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives for MSE and GM of Monumental Sports Network, says the idea to launch virtual simulations came \u201calmost instantaneously and independently\u201d from both MSE and NBC Sports Washington and served as a win for both parties. \u201cI think we both quickly agreed that this was a good idea to pursue,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cThis is an unsettling experience for everyone across our country and obviously in our region, the DMV. Any sense of normalcy, any outlet for entertainment, any outlet for being a fan is really a good thing. We\u2019re always trying to think about our teams as a public trust and our brands, the Capitals and the Wizards, are beloved by fans. There\u2019s an emotional connection to them. When that connection is taken away, it can be an unsettling experience. We wanted to provide fans something fun, something that could provide some sense of normalcy.\u201d \u201cThen from our side, the Wizards and the Monumental side, we wanted to be a really good partner to NBC Sports Washington,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cThey\u2019re not able to broadcast our live games as scheduled at this point in time. We wanted to do our best to support the network and give them great programming so that we can continue to engage with fans.\u201d Damon Phillips, GM of NBC Sports Washington, noted that already-existing infrastructure and MSE\u2019s years-long commitment to esports expedited the process. \u201cThe thing I was most impressed by was the speed to market,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt all started with the vision that we collectively had. We\u2019re lucky at NBC Sports Washington because we are partnered with an ownership group that is one of the most innovative in all of sports. There was a clear vision. We are also lucky that, inside Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, there was a group that was actually capable of pulling off the simulation. It was a perfect storm.\u201d The NBA announced its suspension of the season on March 11. The Wizards launched their first simulated game on March 21 against the Bucks. The \u201cspeed to market\u201d that Phillips referenced was key in making the simulated season feel as real as possible. The fewer games missed, the more it served as an actual replication of the Wizards\u2019 season. Behind the quick work was MSE\u2019s esports division, led by Andrew McNeill. Once the plan was set, it was on McNeill and his team to carry the execution, to provide NBC Sports Washington with a simulation package they could work with, under all the normal parameters of a TV broadcast that don\u2019t normally apply to video games \u2013 and most importantly, to make it feel real. \u201cWe went through the process of loading up (the game), figuring out the schedules, making sure the rosters were as up to date as possible and figuring out the settings for the game,\u201d McNeill said. \u201cThe NBC Sports Washington folks had a specific time of gameplay that they were looking at to filter into their broadcast time. So we had to fiddle with game speed, length of periods and quarters and just figure out\u2026how best to come up with a length of game that was going to be best suited for NBC Sports Washington.\u201d Beyond just the mechanics of the game, MSE and NBC Sports Washington wanted to go the extra mile to ensure that the simulation was as close to the real thing as it could be. McNeill said his team leaned heavily on the teams\u2019 marketing departments to assure that the adjustable branding elements of the game, such as jersey variations, matched the occasion. If the Wizards were going to wear their City Edition jerseys for a particular game before the announcement of the season\u2019s suspension, that\u2019s the jersey they would wear in that game\u2019s simulation. Rosters were also adjusted to make sure that lineups were accurate and that players injured in real life would not appear in the simulated game. \u201cWe tried to make it as true to life as possible,\u201d McNeill said. Leonsis credited the multi-departmental effort put in by both sides to make the game experience replicate that of a normal game night experience: highlights, analysis, score updates and commentary from players. The team even ran a bobblehead giveaway the night Bradley Beal\u2019s Black Panther-themed bobblehead was set to be distributed at Capital One Arena and provided discount codes to jerseys in the virtual finale against the Pacers on Wednesday. The Wizards played a total of 13 simulated games over what would have been the final month of the NBA\u2019s regular season, capped with a win over the Pacers on Wednesday night. The games did their part to fill both a broadcast and wider business gap, gave fans a new point of engagement and provided some sense of regularity to an otherwise upended sports schedule. The impact did not go unnoticed. \u201cI received a number of phone calls from other regional sports networks to ask how we pulled this off,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI also got calls from some teams as well. I think everyone is definitely looking to fill that void that\u2019s out there. We were able to move pretty quickly on this. I think the (Phoenix) Suns were doing some sort of esports on digital platforms, but we were the first to do it on linear TV.\u201d With the simulated season now over, it\u2019s back to the drawing board for all parties involved with filling the content void. Classic Wizards games from years past and coverage of the WNBA Draft are among the D.C. basketball programming options on the horizon. Luckily, for fans who enjoyed the broadcasted 2K experience, they won\u2019t have to wait long for more. Leonsis noted that the NBA 2K League, which was set to tip off for its third season in late March but was delayed by the COVID-19 outbreak, is nearing a return. \u201cThe NBA 2K League is about to begin remote play for their regular season closer to the end of this month,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be producing a lot of games\u2026that will hopefully be a really great live game experience.\u201d "}

Bertans has done just that and more, using the 2019-20 as his breakout campaign and putting his name on the map as one of the best shooters in the league. Through 64 games, Bertans has 25 outings this season with four-plus 3-pointers off the bench, the most in the league by nine games and just two games behind the NBA\u2019s all-time record. He has 16 games with at least five triples and has already broken the franchise record for threes in a team\u2019s first 70 games, despite appearing in just 53 games. Below is a look at Bertans\u2019s top three performances of the season. 3. December 5, 2019 vs. Philadelphia In the middle of what was his best stretch of the season so far, Bertans put on one the best heat check performances the league has seen this season. In the second quarter alone, the Latvian Laser packed in more 3-point production than he normally fits into an average game. Coming off the bench late in the first quarter with the Wizards facing a double-digit deficit, Bertans almost singlehandedly shot Washington back into the game. He hit a triple with less than three seconds left in the first quarter, his first points of the game, to bring the Wizards back within single digits. It was the second quarter, however, where he really made his mark. Bertans went 7-7 (1.000) from the field and 5-5 (1.000) from 3-point range in in a second quarter in which Washington outscored Philadelphia 40-22. Down five with just over five minutes left in the half, Bertans converted from beyond the arc on three straight possessions, sparking a 19-4 run that gave Washington a double-digit lead going into halftime. Bertans was 8-8 from the field and 6-6 from 3-point range in the first half, becoming the first Wizards player to hit at least six 3-pointers in a half without a miss since Trevor Ariza on March 1, 2014. \"You just smile\u2026He makes it look so easy,\u201d Wizards head coach Scott Brooks said postgame. \u201cIt's only maybe a few people in the league, that can take those shots and have the confidence to take and make them. I thought the ball movement, his ability to space the floor is like the best in the league at that position.\u201d  2. March 1, 2020 at Golden State After a first half in which he scored just six points, Bertans came out of the break and dominated the second half en route to an historic tandem performance with Bradley Beal. He checked in for his first action of the second half with 4:38 left in the third quarter and hit threes on Washington\u2019s first two possessions. A Wizards lead that had been just four early in the second half hit 21 when Bertans converted on a finger roll in the closing seconds of the third. But Bertans was just getting warmed up. In the fourth quarter, Bertans converted on all five of his 3-point attempts, scoring 15 points and helping Washington close out a 14-point win. Bertans finished 8-10 (.800) from deep, his second of three games this season with at least eight 3-pointers. In addition to Bertans\u2019s eight 3-pointers, Bradley Beal converted on seven of his own, making the duo the first pair of teammates in franchise history to hit at least seven 3-pointers in the same game.  1. December 10, 2019 at Charlotte Bertans notched the highest scoring game of his career in early December, bookending a stretch of five 20-point performances in six games, with a 32-point outing against the Hornets. Bertans scored just two points in the first quarter and did most of his damage after halftime, scoring 21 points on 6-9 (.667) from deep. Overall, Bertans finished 8-12 (.667) from beyond the arc, setting what was then a career high for 3-pointers made. \u201cThe guy is a bucket getter,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cHe can get buckets all throughout the floor. Every shot is a great shot because it\u2019s always squared up. He has a great release and he has such a high release and he\u2019s 6\u201910\u201d and we needed every one of them.\u201d With the Wizards down by 16 late in the third quarter, Bertans hit three triples in the final 1:45 of the quarter and scored 15 points in a 2:52 span between the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarter, propelling Washington into the lead. Despite the Wizards\u2019 loss, Bertans finished plus-17 on the night. \u201cI was just trying to do my job,\u201d Bertans said. \u201cThey were in there guarding me closer and I was just trying to come off screens and\u2026just kind of have the defense gravitate toward me and somebody else can get open. I think we got a lot of good looks at the end.\u201d  "}

Hachimura answered questions from fans all over the world for over 30 minutes, touching on his methods of staying in shape away from the basketball court, the biggest challenges of his rookie season so far, what he wants to improve in year two, Bradley Beal as a leader, the hardest player he had to guard all season and more. Below are three takeaways from Hachimura\u2019s Q&amp;A.  Where he\u2019s improved the most this season Hachimura said he\u2019s spent time during the NBA\u2019s hiatus working through film of the season so far and has been able to pinpoint areas of his game he wants to continue to work on, like free throw and 3-point shooting, but says he\u2019s also seen a ton of development in his game. \u201cI improved a lot of things,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cEspecially ball-handling and spacing. I remember I used to say, \u2018the spacing is so different.\u2019 At the beginning of the season, I felt a little bit awkward and it felt different, but now I\u2019m used to it and really more comfortable\u2026playing with these guys, my teammates, is really fun. We have more chemistry now.\u201d He noted how different the court looked to him later in the season compared to his first few games of his career and that the improvement is just a matter of reps, watching film and playing time. Locker room leadership When asked who has been the best mentor for him this season, Hachimura said there was one name that stood out among the group. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot, but obviously Brad (Beal) is a guy I\u2019m always looking at,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cI talk to him about basketball and off the court, everything. He\u2019s a great leader of the team. I think it\u2019s good to see, even at practice, I can watch him and how hard he works\u2026He\u2019s not much of a talking guy. He shows. Whatever he\u2019s doing, I can see\u2026He\u2019s the guy I always look at.\u201d Hachimura\u2019s earliest basketball inspiration Hachimura said that the first inspiration he had when he first got into basketball was Carmelo Anthony and that he always made sure to focus on his footwork and ability to get a shot up from anywhere. \u201cI watched a lot of Carmelo Anthony,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cHe was my guy when I started playing basketball. I watched his footsteps and his pull-up shot. That why I think I have a pull-up now, because I watched him a lot. He\u2019s obviously a big guy,  6\u20198\u201d and a power forward or small forward. I watched him a lot when I was a kid\u2026He was one of the (hardest players to guard all season).\u201d "}

Just like the rest of us, basketball players are trying to keep their body fat down and their muscle mass up. Here are some tips to help you achieve your body composition goals. How to keep body fat down and muscle up: 1. Focus on lean protein, vegetables, beans, healthy fats, fruit and whole grains. Have protein with every meal (and snack). 2.  Eat carbs around your workouts (for most people it works best to have carbs at breakfast and do a mid morning workout). 3.  Avoid highly processed foods such as white bread, crackers, cookies and fast food. 4.  Look for \u201chidden\u201d sugars in foods. Read labels and avoid foods with added sugars. Did you know that a container of fruit yogurt can have more sugar than 4 Oreo cookies? 5.  Stay hydrated. Dehydration decreases metabolic rate. The best way to stay hydrated is to drink water - if you\u2019re sweating a lot and working out for more than an hour, you can have a sports drink with electrolytes. 6.  Drink a large glass of water, a bowl of broth or a large mug of green tea or herbal tea before meals. Also, start your lunch and dinner with a big salad. Fiber and water (particularly warm fluids, like tea and broth) send a signal of fullness to your brain and help keep you from overeating. 7.  Cut out alcohol, juices and sodas. 8.  Have 2 tbsp of ground flaxseeds per day. Important that they not be whole flaxseeds (your body will not break them down well enough). Most people either stir it into oatmeal with breakfast, add to a smoothie or sprinkle over a salad. 9.  Get spicy! Spicy foods, herbs, garlic, hot peppers all help boost metabolic rate. If you have a favorite brand of hot sauce, carry it with you in your bag or purse (hey, it works for Beyonce....). 10. Practice portion control. If you\u2019re someone who is tempted to get seconds (or thirds) wait at least twenty minutes before going back for more. If you\u2019re still hungry, go for more vegetables and protein and save the carbs for another meal.

Before he got to questions, though, Sheppard opened with a message for the Wizards\u2019 fanbase. \u201cFrom the Wizards family, to all our fans: we miss you,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get back out there and perform and have a team that you can be proud of and support. In this time that we\u2019re not able to do that, we\u2019re trying to use it as wisely as possible. Stay safe, wash your hands, social distancing, all the obvious things that we can\u2019t say enough.\u201d Sheppard, who earlier this year conducted an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session on Reddit and will appear next week on the Wizards Podcast Network\u2019s Full Court Press podcast, took questions Thursday from his home. Sheppard touched on staying connected, keeping players in shape, prioritizing the fan experience, John Wall, Rui Hachimura, Bradley Beal, the scouting process and more. Below are five key takeaways from Sheppard\u2019s Q&amp;A session.  The Wizards\u2019 efforts to stay connected as a team As the Wizards and all the other teams around the league look for ways to maintain a season\u2019s worth of built up camaraderie, the organization has gotten creative in its efforts to keep the team connected and engaged with one another. \u201cIn terms of the players and our staff, we are staying connected,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe stay connected every day in some way, shape or fashion. We found a lot of great activities that we can do that have become team building. The ability to get several people on the phone or on the computer and see each other\u2019s faces has been invaluable. We have group workouts, team ball-handling and group yoga. We\u2019ve included the Mystics in a lot of the things that we do. We\u2019re keeping contact with the Go-Go. Our basketball community is fine. We\u2019re healthy and we\u2019re safe, we just miss our fans and we hope our fans are certainly healthy.\u201d While Sheppard is proud of the organization\u2019s ability to maintain a feeling of togetherness, he knows nothing will compare to the moment everyone walks back through the doors of the practice facility for the first time. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m looking forward to (the most) is that first day,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThat first time we\u2019re back together in the facility and the celebration of getting back to what we\u2019re great at doing, what we\u2019re blessed to do in the NBA.\u201d The importance of players staying in shape on hiatus With no access to team facilities and stay-at-home mandates across the country, players face a unique challenge when it comes to keeping fit for the eventual return to play. While Sheppard recognizes the challenges they face, he knows and emphasizes to the players the importance of prioritizing their physical conditioning. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to stay ready than to get ready. This is a little bit unusual for basketball players to go more than a day without touching a basketball. It\u2019s unusual to go more than a week \u2013 they\u2019re normally injured or sick. To go more than two weeks, it\u2019s almost an impossible situation to ask them, \u2018When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been away from a court this long?\u2019 It\u2019s never happened.\u201d The team has taken a number of measures to make staying fit more convenient for the players. Dr. Daniel Medina, the team\u2019s Chief of Athlete Care and Performance, said earlier this week on the Off The Bench podcast that his staff has provided players with workout equipment kits, including resistance bands and weights, to help them stay fit at home. The group convenes through Zoom for workouts, yoga and meditation. The nutrition staff has provided players with tips an on-call guidance to help them responsibly navigate the kitchen. Sheppard wants to take the challenges that players are facing and \u201cthe misery of missing the game\u201d and channel that as a group. \u201cIt\u2019s like group therapy the way we\u2019re getting guys together,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re working hard, but they\u2019re having fun at the same time.\u201d An update on John Wall Sheppard addressed one of the biggest questions on Wizards fans\u2019 minds these days \u2013 would the league\u2019s hiatus have any impact on John Wall\u2019s ability to return to the court this season? Sheppard said that while he would have loved to see it as much as anyone, \u201cit\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d Sheppard then provided an update on some of the work Wall has been doing behind the scenes to prepare for his eventual return to action, the progress he\u2019s made and how the league\u2019s hiatus impacts his timeline. \u201cWe were scrimmaging [with Wall] before,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cOn March 12, John scrimmaged for the sixth time with the Go-Go. He had gone through a lot of practices with the Wizards, shaking the rust off and trying to get his legs back to get into shape. To the untrained eye, you\u2019d walk in and say \u2018Wow, he looks fantastic.\u2019 And he does. But in the NBA, the elite player that John is, to be in NBA top shape, he was definitely not that\u2026He\u2019ll be in great shape coming out of this because he\u2019s working hard every day, but from a basketball training perspective, he\u2019s just not able to get out on the floor and do those things.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what, we saw enough with John through this path in all the practices, all the scrimmages that he\u2019s been through that next season, I can\u2019t wait for it to get here for him,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe certainly are looking forward of the rest of this season. That\u2019s where our focus is, but in the back of my mind, I feel pretty good that we're going to get a five-time All-Star back [next season] at a really, really high level. John is so excited to get back in front of our Wizards fans.\u201d Rui\u2019s rookie season One of the highlights of the Wizards\u2019 season so far has been the immediate impact made by rookie Rui Hachimura. Drafted ninth overall in last year\u2019s draft, Hachimura has averaged 13.4 points and 6.0 rebounds per game this season and started all 41 of the games he has appeared in. Sheppard was thrilled to see Hachimura succeed so early, but was by no means surprised. \u201cI had very high expectations of Rui because I was very familiar with the player and the character of the kid and the competitiveness of the kid,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cHe exceeded (those expectations) as a rookie. To come in and get the starting job from day one and to produce the way he was producing. He was a great fit, seamless fit, our players love playing with him.\u201d \u201cOne thing about Rui and all of our bigs, we want them to be versatile. To be able to guard multiple positions and to be able to be sufficient on the floor at different positions at different times during the game. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re really hopefully with Rui to increase his ball-handling and give him some opportunities to play the wing. The more versatile you are, the more tools you have in the toolbox to go out and match up with anybody out on the floor. We\u2019re really trying to observe how the game is being played and certainly what the future of the game is.\u201d Sheppard said that Hachimura\u2019s development is a key element of the Wizards\u2019 plan for the future. Continuing to diversify his skillset and his ability play multiple positions could unlock a number of lineups and options for the Wizards\u2019 roster in the future. \u201cWe envision putting a team out on the floor that has shooters like Beal out there, Bertans out there, then you throw Rui who can hit the three and even Thomas Bryant can hit a three and roll to the rim. Think about John Wall distributing to those guys. Think about the other team trying to guard those guys. That puts a lot of pressure on the defense when you have shooters out on the floor.\u201d The challenges and advantages of the remote scouting process While the league\u2019s and teams\u2019 focus remain on making the most of the current season, front offices must continue their usual work preparing for the 2020 NBA Draft. Sheppard said that while the current circumstances may prevent a number of the normal scouting procedures (individual workouts, the combine, in-person interviews, etc.), he said it may have less of an impact on the team\u2019s process than it may seem. \u201cThis is actually a normal time for us,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe're just taking more time on each player to find out who the best fits for the Wizards are. We\u2019re digesting so much more video as a group collectively as a group, going over players in far more detail. This may end being the way we do the draft moving forward.\u201d \u201cWorkouts are important, but they\u2019ve played all season\u2026we\u2019ve done our homework. We have a tremendous scouting staff that\u2019s scoured the United States and the globe to find the very best talent. We have a database stuffed full of reports. We\u2019ve done the preparation work. If we don\u2019t have the opportunity to actually spend time physically with players, watch them work out and do interviews, we just pivot.\u201d Sheppard then provided an update on the team\u2019s scouting timeline, saying that interviews with select prospects will begin Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start next week doing video conference interviews with the top seniors that are in college now and some international players,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe are allowed to do that. We have to wait for the underclassmen list to come out. When that does come out, we\u2019ll be able to do even more interviews. It\u2019s been great. We look forward to that. It starts Monday for us with some seniors. It makes it feel very normal. That\u2019s what we would be doing normally at this time of year.\u201d "}

Q: First off, take us through your career path and your current role with the organization. Van Stone: I have had the pleasure of working in professional sports in both the NBA and the NHL for the better part of last 25+ years. In that timeframe, I\u2019ve worked for franchises in Philadelphia, Phoenix and Cleveland along with the last 14 years in Washington, D.C. with Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment. My responsibility has been primarily in the revenue development and marketing scope of our business and as a leader it\u2019s been built around helping a variety of our different departmental people leaders set strategy and goals for the organization to help grow the business and build our fanbase and corporate support. Q: Since the addition of Rui Hachimura, you made a few visits to Japan. What\u2019s your impression of the sports business world in Japan? Van Stone: It has been an honor to meet so many new people on my three visits to Japan. I find the people to be really enthusiastic about sports and its unique ability to bring people together. My first visit was in September 2019 around the time frame of the Rugby World Cup and to see the country take such great honor in hosting the event was a really fantastic experience. In addition, I am really excited about the growth and development of basketball in Japan from the youth to the professional levels. There is a huge passion about growing the sport at the grassroots level for both boys and girls. That is very exciting and the right way to do it. The addition of Rui to the Washington Wizards has enabled us to begin to build a relationship and connection to both basketball and all-around sports fans in Japan.  This is especially an exciting time for our team and also the NBA which last year hosted a very successful Japan games. Q: It\u2019s been about eight months since drafting Rui Hachimura. What kind of expectation did you have after that draft and what kind of results have you seen so far? Van Stone: The response and support that we received from Japanese fans over the last eight months has been absolutely amazing. The support that we are seeing for Rui and the Wizards on a nightly basis at our games from visiting Japanese fans and also Japanese Americans attending has been so much more than we ever expected. It\u2019s a very humbling experience but it has also created a level of responsibility for us organizationally that we have to create as much Japanese language content as we can to develop a relationship with the market to make fans feel like they\u2019re at home even when Rui and Wizards are playing so far away.  We also saw very quickly with the amount of Japanese media covering Rui\u2019s first press conference in Washington after the NBA Draft that his popularity was a very unique opportunity for our organization. The support of the corporate market has also been amazing. We were very quickly able to develop a great partnership with NEC. As partners we share so much synergies both foundational and culturally in the way we operate our businesses. The beginning of our relationship as partners has been both seamless and exciting as we\u2019ve been able to launch a variety of new programs together. Q: What kind of possibility do you see in the Japanese market for the Washington Wizards? Van Stone: We see incredible growth and engagement in Japan. It\u2019s a keen responsibility of ours to develop a very robust relationship with the basketball and youth sports community, the business community and also fans of sports in general in Japan. It is our goal for the Wizards to become the most popular NBA team in Japan and grow the global game of basketball. Even with the long distance some of the early engagement opportunities that we developed have included pre-and postgame reports about the team in Japanese, unique off the court content that tells a story of our players and team and what they do besides basketball, a weekly Japanese language radio podcast that covers interviews with influential people in the game of basketball, Japanese media personalities that cover and follow the wizards along with players, coaches and other celebrity personalities. Most importantly, as we move forward, we want to do more local activations in Japan with members of our organization. Helping in the efforts to grow the game of basketball, the Wizards and the NBA is a high priority for us. Q: The Wizards are currently operating a Japanese twitter, Instagram and an official website, but what are ways you\u2019re hoping to use these outlets to further the Wizards brand internationally? Van Stone: Our whole priority is to bring global to local. We want fans to have the full experience. These platforms allow us to engage fans in truly real time opportunities and connect with fans in a way that is important to them. This is something that we believe is critical to developing our relationship with fans in Japan. Not only do we have offerings on these platforms, but we\u2019ve also recruited and hired global and Japanese content professionals to help us engage with the community. This includes members of our own staff but we also a local agency in Sports Branding Japan, that assists us on strategy and activation. Their knowledge and experience in the market has been very valuable. Rui\u2019s interest has set a new standard as the most popular jersey sold In Japan in just his first year in the NBA.  His success has also elevated the popularity of other players on our team in Japan including Bradley Beal and Scott Brooks, so developing content around the full team has been a positive addition to our content and connectivity planning. Q: Are there any unique or interesting business opportunities that have come up because of drafting Rui that wouldn\u2019t have in the past? Van Stone: Early last year for the first time ever, the NBA allowed teams to do their own international sponsorships with brands in global markets. The opportunity truly allows teams like our Wizards to activate and localize markets outside of the Greater Washington region on a much broader landscape. This opportunity combined with the support of Rui in Japan has allowed us to look at creating relationships in Japan on a much broader connection than we\u2019ve ever been able to do before. Q: When you look for a partner with the Washington Wizards, what do you look for the most in a company? Van Stone: We look for a partner that shares the same philosophies as us is an organization. One that is always forward thinking, entrepreneurial in spirit and trying new things, a company that is committed to high levels of customer satisfaction and creating Hall of Fame memories for their clients and one at the core of who they are is focused on utilizing new technology to grow their business. Customers should be a factor in every decision we make. Ensuring that they feel valued and that they receive a positive return on their investment, time and engagement is critical. Q: After signing a deal with a sponsorship company, how do you proceed in making the most out of the deal for activation ideas? Van Stone: I think we approach the opportunity like we would with any partner whether they\u2019re local or in a different country. We want to understand what the goals and objectives are for the partner and develop the right programming that allows them to reach those goals and create an ROI on the partnership. "}
